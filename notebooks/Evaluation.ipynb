       "'\\n  \"Thus spoke the sage: the kings without delay\\n  Dissolve the council, and their chief obey.\"\\n\\n  POPE\\'S _Iliad._\\n\\n\\nA single moment served to convince the youth that he was mistaken. A\\nhand was laid, with a powerful pressure, on his arm, and the low voice\\nof Uncas muttered in his ears,--\\n\\n\"The Hurons are dogs. The sight of a coward\\'s blood can never make a\\nwarrior tremble. The \\'Gray Head\\' and the Sagamore are safe, and the\\nrifle of Hawkeye is not asleep. Go,--Uncas and the \\'Open Hand\\' are now\\nstrangers. It is enough.\"\\n\\nHeyward would gladly have heard more, but a gentle push from his friend\\nurged him towards the door, and admonished him of the danger that might\\nattend the discovery of their intercourse. Slowly and reluctantly\\nyielding to the necessity, he quitted the place, and mingled with the\\nthrong that hovered nigh. The dying fires in the clearing cast a dim and\\nuncertain light on the dusky figures that were silently stalking to and\\nfro; and occasionally a brighter gleam than common glanced into the\\nlodge, and exhibited the figure of Uncas still maintaining its upright\\nattitude near the dead body of the Huron.\\n\\nA knot of warriors soon entered the place again, and reissuing, they\\nbore the senseless remains into the adjacent woods. After this\\ntermination of the scene, Duncan wandered among the lodges, unquestioned\\nand unnoticed, endeavoring to find some trace of her in whose behalf he\\nincurred the risk he ran. In the present temper of the tribe, it would\\nhave been easy to have fled and rejoined his companions, had such a wish\\ncrossed his mind. But, in addition to the never-ceasing anxiety on\\naccount of Alice, a fresher, though feebler interest in the fate of\\nUncas assisted to chain him to the spot. He continued, therefore, to\\nstray from hut to hut, looking into each only to encounter additional\\ndisappointment, until he had made the entire circuit of the village.\\nAbandoning a species of inquiry that proved so fruitless, he retraced\\nhis steps to the council lodge, resolved to seek and question David, in\\norder to put an end to his doubts.\\n\\nOn reaching the building which had proved alike the seat of judgment\\nand the place of execution, the young man found that the excitement had\\nalready subsided. The warriors had reassembled, and were now calmly\\nsmoking, while they conversed gravely on the chief incidents of their\\nrecent expedition to the head of the Horican. Though the return of\\nDuncan was likely to remind them of his character, and the suspicious\\ncircumstances of his visit, it produced no visible sensation. So far,\\nthe terrible scene that had just occurred proved favorable to his views,\\nand he required no other prompter than his own feelings to convince him\\nof the expediency of profiting by so unexpected an advantage.\\n\\nWithout seeming to hesitate, he walked into the lodge, and took his seat\\nwith a gravity that accorded admirably with the deportment of his hosts.\\nA hasty but searching glance sufficed to tell him that, though Uncas\\nstill remained where he had left him, David had not reappeared. No other\\nrestraint was imposed on the former than the watchful looks of a young\\nHuron, who had placed himself at hand; though an armed warrior leaned\\nagainst the post that formed one side of the narrow door-way. In every\\nother respect, the captive seemed at liberty; still he was excluded from\\nall participation in the discourse, and possessed much more of the air\\nof some finely moulded statue than a man having life and volition.\\n\\nHeyward had too recently witnessed a frightful instance of the prompt\\npunishments of the people into whose hands he had fallen, to hazard an\\nexposure by any officious boldness. He would greatly have preferred\\nsilence and meditation to speech, when a discovery of his real condition\\nmight prove so instantly fatal. Unfortunately for this prudent\\nresolution, his entertainers appeared otherwise disposed. He had not\\nlong occupied the seat wisely taken a little in the shade, when another\\nof the elder warriors, who spoke the French language, addressed him:--\\n\\n\"My Canada father does not forget his children,\" said the chief; \"I\\nthank him. An evil spirit lives in the wife of one of my young men. Can\\nthe cunning stranger frighten him away?\"\\n\\nHeyward possessed some knowledge of the mummery practised among the\\nIndians, in the cases of such supposed visitations. He saw, at a glance,\\nthat the circumstance might possibly be improved to further his own end.\\nIt would, therefore, have been difficult, just then, to have uttered a\\nproposal that would have given him more satisfaction. Aware of the\\nnecessity of preserving the dignity of his imaginary character, however,\\nhe repressed his feelings, and answered with suitable mystery,--\\n\\n\"Spirits differ; some yield to the power of wisdom, while others are too\\nstrong.\"\\n\\n\"My brother is a great medicine,\" said the cunning savage; \"he will\\ntry?\"\\n\\nA gesture of assent was the answer. The Huron was content with the\\nassurance, and resuming his pipe, he awaited the proper moment to move.\\nThe impatient Heyward, inwardly execrating the cold customs of the\\nsavages, which required such sacrifices to appearance, was fain to\\nassume an air of indifference, equal to that maintained by the chief,\\nwho was, in truth, a near relative of the afflicted woman. The minutes\\nlingered, and the delay had seemed an hour to the adventurer in\\nempiricism, when the Huron laid aside his pipe, and drew his robe across\\nhis breast, as if about to lead the way to the lodge of the invalid.\\nJust then, a warrior of powerful frame darkened the door, and stalking\\nsilently among the attentive group, he seated himself on one end of the\\nlow pile of brush which sustained Duncan. The latter cast an impatient\\nlook at his neighbor, and felt his flesh creep with uncontrollable\\nhorror when he found himself in actual contact with Magua.\\n\\nThe sudden return of this artful and dreaded chief caused a delay in the\\ndeparture of the Huron. Several pipes, that had been extinguished, were\\nlighted again; while the newcomer, without speaking a word, drew his\\ntomahawk from his girdle, and filling the bowl on its head, began to\\ninhale the vapors of the weed through the hollow handle, with as much\\nindifference as if he had not been absent two weary days on a long and\\ntoilsome hunt. Ten minutes, which appeared so many ages to Duncan, might\\nhave passed in this manner; and the warriors were fairly enveloped in a\\ncloud of white smoke before any of them spoke.\\n\\n\"Welcome!\" one at length uttered; \"has my friend found the moose?\"\\n\\n\"The young men stagger under their burdens,\" returned Magua. \"Let\\n\\'Reed-that-bends\\' go on the hunting-path; he will meet them.\"\\n\\nA deep and awful silence succeeded the utterance of the forbidden name.\\nEach pipe dropped from the lips of its owner as though all had inhaled\\nan impurity at the same instant. The smoke wreathed above their heads in\\nlittle eddies, and curling in a spiral form, it ascended swiftly\\nthrough the opening in the roof of the lodge, leaving the place beneath\\nclear of its fumes, and each dark visage distinctly visible. The looks\\nof most of the warriors were riveted on the earth; though a few of the\\nyounger and less gifted of the party suffered their wild and glaring\\neyeballs to roll in the direction of a white-headed savage, who sat\\nbetween two of the most venerated chiefs of the tribe. There was nothing\\nin the air or attire of this Indian that would seem to entitle him to\\nsuch a distinction. The former was rather depressed, than remarkable for\\nthe bearing of the natives; and the latter was such as was commonly worn\\nby the ordinary men of the nation. Like most around him, for more than a\\nminute his look too was on the ground; but, trusting his eyes at length\\nto steal a glance aside, he perceived that he was becoming an object of\\ngeneral attention. Then he arose and lifted his voice in the general\\nsilence.\\n\\n\"It was a lie,\" he said; \"I had no son. He who was called by that name\\nis forgotten; his blood was pale; and it came not from the veins of a\\nHuron; the wicked Chippewas cheated my squaw. The Great Spirit has said,\\nthat the family of Wiss-entush should end; he is happy who knows that\\nthe evil of his race dies with himself. I have done.\"\\n\\nThe speaker, who was the father of the recreant young Indian, looked\\nround and about him, as if seeking commendation of his stoicism in the\\neyes of his auditors. But the stern customs of his people had made too\\nsevere an exaction of the feeble old man. The expression of his eye\\ncontradicted his figurative and boastful language, while every muscle in\\nhis wrinkled visage was working with anguish. Standing a single minute\\nto enjoy his bitter triumph, he turned away, as if sickening at the gaze\\nof men, and veiling his face in his blanket, he walked from the lodge\\nwith the noiseless step of an Indian, seeking, in the privacy of his own\\nabode, the sympathy of one like himself, aged, forlorn, and childless.\\n\\nThe Indians, who believe in the hereditary transmission of virtues and\\ndefects in character, suffered him to depart in silence. Then, with an\\nelevation of breeding that many in a more cultivated state of society\\nmight profitably emulate, one of the chiefs drew the attention of the\\nyoung men from the weakness they had just witnessed, by saying, in a\\ncheerful voice, addressing himself in courtesy to Magua, as the newest\\ncomer,--\\n\\n\"The Delawares have been like bears after the honey-pots, prowling\\naround my village. But who has ever found a Huron asleep?\"\\n\\nThe darkness of the impending cloud which precedes a burst of thunder\\nwas not blacker than the brow of Magua as he exclaimed,--\\n\\n\"The Delawares of the Lakes!\"\\n\\n\"Not so. They who wear the petticoats of squaws, on their own river. One\\nof them has been passing the tribe.\"\\n\\n\"Did my young men take his scalp?\"\\n\\n\"His legs were good, though his arm is better for the hoe than the\\ntomahawk,\" returned the other, pointing to the immovable form of Uncas.\\n\\nInstead of manifesting any womanish curiosity to feast his eyes with the\\nsight of a captive from a people he was known to have so much reason to\\nhate, Magua continued to smoke, with the meditative air that he usually\\nmaintained, when there was no immediate call on his cunning or his\\neloquence. Although secretly amazed at the facts communicated by the\\nspeech of the aged father, he permitted himself to ask no questions,\\nreserving his inquiries for a more suitable moment. It was only after a\\nsufficient interval that he shook the ashes from his pipe, replaced the\\ntomahawk, tightened his girdle, and arose, casting for the first time a\\nglance in the direction of the prisoner, who stood a little behind him.\\nThe wary, though seemingly abstracted Uncas, caught a glimpse of the\\nmovement, and turning suddenly to the light, their looks met. Near a\\nminute these two bold and untamed spirits stood regarding one another\\nsteadily in the eye, neither quailing in the least before the fierce\\ngaze he encountered. The form of Uncas dilated, and his nostrils opened\\nlike those of a tiger at bay; but so rigid and unyielding was his\\nposture, that he might easily have been converted by the imagination\\ninto an exquisite and faultless representation of the warlike deity of\\nhis tribe. The lineaments of the quivering features of Magua proved more\\nductile; his countenance gradually lost its character of defiance in an\\nexpression of ferocious joy, and heaving a breath from the very bottom\\nof his chest, he pronounced aloud the very formidable name of--\\n\\n\"Le Cerf Agile!\"\\n\\nEach warrior sprang upon his feet at the utterance of the well known\\nappellation, and there was a short period during which the stoical\\nconstancy of the natives was completely conquered by surprise. The\\nhated and yet respected name was repeated as by one voice, carrying the\\nsound even beyond the limits of the lodge. The women and children, who\\nlingered around the entrance, took up the words in an echo, which was\\nsucceeded by another shrill and plaintive howl. The latter was not yet\\nended, when the sensation among the men had entirely abated. Each one in\\npresence seated himself, as though ashamed of his precipitation; but it\\nwas many minutes before their meaning eyes ceased to roll towards their\\ncaptive, in curious examination of a warrior who had so often proved his\\nprowess on the best and proudest of their nation. Uncas enjoyed his\\nvictory, but was content with merely exhibiting his triumph by a quiet\\nsmile--an emblem of scorn which belongs to all time and every nation.\\n\\nMagua caught the expression, and raising his arm, he shook it at the\\ncaptive, the light silver ornaments attached to his bracelet rattling\\nwith the trembling agitation of the limb, as, in a tone of vengeance, he\\nexclaimed, in English,--\\n\\n\"Mohican, you die!\"\\n\\n\"The healing waters will never bring the dead Hurons to life,\" returned\\nUncas, in the music of the Delawares; \"the tumbling river washes their\\nbones; their men are squaws; their women owls. Go! call together the\\nHuron dogs, that they may look upon a warrior. My nostrils are offended;\\nthey scent the blood of a coward.\"\\n\\nThe latter allusion struck deep, and the injury rankled. Many of the\\nHurons understood the strange tongue in which the captive spoke, among\\nwhich number was Magua. This cunning savage beheld, and instantly\\nprofited by his advantage. Dropping the light robe of skin from his\\nshoulder, he stretched forth his arm, and commenced a burst of his\\ndangerous and artful eloquence. However much his influence among his\\npeople had been impaired by his occasional and besetting weakness, as\\nwell as by his desertion of the tribe, his courage and his fame as an\\norator were undeniable. He never spoke without auditors, and rarely\\nwithout making converts to his opinions. On the present occasion, his\\nnative powers were stimulated by the thirst of revenge.\\n\\nHe again recounted the events of the attack on the island at Glenn\\'s,\\nthe death of his associates, and the escape of their most formidable\\nenemies. Then he described the nature and position of the mount whither\\nhe had led such captives as had fallen into their hands. Of his own\\nbloody intentions towards the maidens, and of his baffled malice he made\\nno mention, but passed rapidly on to the surprise of the party by La\\nLongue Carabine, and its fatal termination. Here he paused, and looked\\nabout him, in affected veneration for the departed, but, in truth, to\\nnote the effect of his opening narrative. As usual, every eye was\\nriveted on his face. Each dusky figure seemed a breathing statue, so\\nmotionless was the posture, so intense the attention of the individual.\\n\\nThen Magua dropped his voice, which had hitherto been clear, strong, and\\nelevated, and touched upon the merits of the dead. No quality that was\\nlikely to command the sympathy of an Indian escaped his notice. One had\\nnever been known to follow the chase in vain; another had been\\nindefatigable on the trail of their enemies. This was brave, that\\ngenerous. In short, he so managed his allusions, that in a nation, which\\nwas composed of so few families, he contrived to strike every chord that\\nmight find, in its turn, some breast in which to vibrate.\\n\\n\"Are the bones of my young men,\" he concluded, \"in the burial-place of\\nthe Hurons? You know they are not. Their spirits are gone towards the\\nsetting sun, and are already crossing the great waters, to the happy\\nhunting-grounds. But they departed without food, without guns or knives,\\nwithout moccasins, naked and poor as they were born. Shall this be? Are\\ntheir souls to enter the land of the just like hungry Iroquois or\\nunmanly Delawares; or shall they meet their friends with arms in their\\nhands and robes on their backs? What will our fathers think the tribes\\nof the Wyandots have become? They will look on their children with a\\ndark eye, and say, Go! a Chippewa has come hither with the name of a\\nHuron. Brothers, we must not forget the dead; a redskin never ceases to\\nremember. We will load the back of this Mohican until he staggers under\\nour bounty, and despatch him after my young men. They call to us for\\naid, though our ears are not open; they say, Forget us not. When they\\nsee the spirit of this Mohican toiling after them with his burden, they\\nwill know we are of that mind. Then will they go on happy; and our\\nchildren will say, \\'So did our fathers to their friends, so must we do\\nto them.\\' What is a Yengee? we have slain many, but the earth is still\\npale. A stain on the name of a Huron can only be hid by blood that comes\\nfrom the veins of an Indian. Let this Delaware die.\"\\n\\nThe effect of such an harangue, delivered in the nervous language and\\nwith the emphatic manner of a Huron orator, could scarcely be mistaken.\\nMagua had so artfully blended the natural sympathies with the religious\\nsuperstition of his auditors, that their minds, already prepared by\\ncustom to sacrifice a victim to the _manes_ of their countrymen, lost\\nevery vestige of humanity in a wish for revenge. One warrior in\\nparticular, a man of wild and ferocious mien, had been conspicuous for\\nthe attention he had given to the words of the speaker. His countenance\\nhad changed with each passing emotion, until it settled into a look of\\ndeadly malice. As Magua ended he arose, and uttering the yell of a\\ndemon, his polished little axe was seen glancing in the torch-light as\\nhe whirled it above his head. The motion and the cry were too sudden for\\nwords to interrupt his bloody intention. It appeared as if a bright\\ngleam shot from his hand, which was crossed at the same moment by a dark\\nand powerful line. The former was the tomahawk in its passage; the\\nlatter the arm that Magua darted forward to divert its aim. The quick\\nand ready motion of the chief was not entirely too late. The keen weapon\\ncut the war-plume from the scalping-tuft of Uncas, and passed through\\nthe frail wall of the lodge, as though it were hurled from some\\nformidable engine.\\n\\nDuncan had seen the threatening action, and sprang upon his feet, with a\\nheart which while it leaped into his throat, swelled with the most\\ngenerous resolution in behalf of his friend. A glance told him that the\\nblow had failed, and terror changed to admiration. Uncas stood still,\\nlooking his enemy in the eye with features that seemed superior to\\nemotion. Marble could not be colder, calmer, or steadier than the\\ncountenance he put upon this sudden and vindictive attack. Then, as if\\npitying a want of skill which had proved so fortunate to himself, he\\nsmiled, and muttered a few words of contempt in his own tongue.\\n\\n\"No!\" said Magua, after satisfying himself of the safety of the captive;\\n\"the sun must shine on his shame; the squaws must see his flesh tremble,\\nor our revenge will be like the play of boys. Go! take him where there\\nis silence; let us see if a Delaware can sleep at night, and in the\\nmorning die.\"\\n\\nThe young men whose duty it was to guard the prisoner instantly passed\\ntheir ligaments of bark across his arms, and led him from the lodge,\\namid a profound and ominous silence. It was only as the figure of Uncas\\nstood in the opening of the door that his firm step hesitated. There he\\nturned, and, in the sweeping and haughty glance that he threw around the\\ncircle of his enemies, Duncan caught a look which he was glad to\\nconstrue into an expression that he was not entirely deserted by hope.\\n\\nMagua was content with his success, or too much occupied with his secret\\npurposes to push his inquiries any further. Shaking his mantle, and\\nfolding it on his bosom, he also quitted the place, without pursuing a\\nsubject which might have proved so fatal to the individual at his elbow.\\nNotwithstanding his rising resentment, his natural firmness, and his\\nanxiety in behalf of Uncas, Heyward felt sensibly relieved by the\\nabsence of so dangerous and so subtle a foe. The excitement produced by\\nthe speech gradually subsided. The warriors resumed their seats, and\\nclouds of smoke once more filled the lodge. For near half an hour, not a\\nsyllable was uttered, or scarcely a look cast aside; a grave and\\nmeditative silence being the ordinary succession to every scene of\\nviolence and commotion among those beings, who were alike so impetuous\\nand yet so self-restrained.\\n\\nWhen the chief who had solicited the aid of Duncan finished his pipe, he\\nmade a final and successful movement towards departing. A motion of a\\nfinger was the intimation he gave the supposed physician to follow; and\\npassing through the clouds of smoke, Duncan was glad, on more accounts\\nthan one, to be able, at last, to breathe the pure air of a cool and\\nrefreshing summer evening.\\n\\nInstead of pursuing his way among those lodges where Heyward had already\\nmade his unsuccessful search, his companion turned aside, and proceeded\\ndirectly towards the base of an adjacent mountain, which overhung the\\ntemporary village. A thicket of brush skirted its foot, and it became\\nnecessary to proceed through a crooked and narrow path. The boys had\\nresumed their sports in the clearing, and were enacting a mimic chase to\\nthe post among themselves. In order to render their games as like the\\nreality as possible, one of the boldest of their number had conveyed a\\nfew brands into some piles of tree-tops that had hitherto escaped the\\nburning. The blaze of one of these fires lighted the way of the chief\\nand Duncan, and gave a character of additional wildness to the rude\\nscenery. At a little distance from a bald rock, and directly in its\\nfront, they entered a grassy opening, which they prepared to cross. Just\\nthen fresh fuel was added to the fire, and a powerful light penetrated\\neven to that distant spot. It fell upon the white surface of the\\nmountain, and was reflected downwards upon a dark and mysterious-looking\\nbeing that arose, unexpectedly, in their path.\\n\\nThe Indian paused, as if doubtful whether to proceed, and permitted his\\ncompanion to approach his side. A large black ball, which at first\\nseemed stationary, now began to move in a manner that to the latter was\\ninexplicable. Again the fire brightened, and its glare fell more\\ndistinctly on the object. Then even Duncan knew it, by its restless and\\nsideling attitudes, which kept the upper part of its form in constant\\nmotion, while the animal itself appeared seated, to be a bear. Though it\\ngrowled loudly and fiercely, and there were instants when its glistening\\neyeballs might be seen, it gave no other indications of hostility. The\\nHuron, at least, seemed assured that the intentions of this singular\\nintruder were peaceable, for after giving it an attentive examination,\\nhe quietly pursued his course.\\n\\nDuncan, who knew that the animal was often domesticated among the\\nIndians, followed the example of his companion, believing that some\\nfavorite of the tribe had found its way into the thicket, in search of\\nfood. They passed it unmolested. Though obliged to come nearly in\\ncontact with the monster, the Huron, who had at first so warily\\ndetermined the character of his strange visitor, was now content with\\nproceeding without wasting a moment in further examination; but Heyward\\nwas unable to prevent his eyes from looking backward, in salutary\\nwatchfulness against attacks in the rear. His uneasiness was in no\\ndegree diminished when he perceived the beast rolling along their path,\\nand following their footsteps. He would have spoken, but the Indian at\\nthat moment shoved aside a door of bark, and entered a cavern in the\\nbosom of the mountain.\\n\\nProfiting by so easy a method of retreat, Duncan stepped after him, and\\nwas gladly closing the slight cover to the opening, when he felt it\\ndrawn from his hand by the beast, whose shaggy form immediately darkened\\nthe passage. They were now in a straight and long gallery, in a chasm of\\nthe rocks, where retreat without encountering the animal was impossible.\\nMaking the best of the circumstances, the young man pressed forward,\\nkeeping as close as possible to his conductor. The bear growled\\nfrequently at his heels, and once or twice its enormous paws were laid\\non his person, as if disposed to prevent his further passage into the\\nden.\\n\\nHow long the nerves of Heyward would have sustained him in this\\nextraordinary situation, it might be difficult to decide; for, happily,\\nhe soon found relief. A glimmer of light had constantly been in their\\nfront, and they now arrived at the place whence it proceeded.\\n\\nA large cavity in the rock had been rudely fitted to answer the purposes\\nof many apartments. The subdivisions were simple but ingenious, being\\ncomposed of stone, sticks, and bark, intermingled. Openings above\\nadmitted the light by day, and at night fires and torches supplied the\\nplace of the sun. Hither the Hurons had brought most of their valuables,\\nespecially those which more particularly pertained to the nation; and\\nhither, as it now appeared, the sick woman, who was believed to be the\\nvictim of supernatural power, had been transported also, under an\\nimpression that her tormentor would find more difficulty in making his\\nassaults through walls of stone than through the leafy coverings of the\\nlodges. The apartment into which Duncan and his guide first entered, had\\nbeen exclusively devoted to her accommodation. The latter approached her\\nbedside, which was surrounded by females, in the centre of whom Heyward\\nwas surprised to find his missing friend David.\\n\\nA single look was sufficient to apprise the pretended leech that the\\ninvalid was far beyond his powers of healing. She lay in a sort of\\nparalysis, indifferent to the objects which crowded before her sight,\\nand happily unconscious of suffering. Heyward was far from regretting\\nthat his mummeries were to be performed on one who was much too ill to\\ntake an interest in their failure or success. The slight qualm of\\nconscience which had been excited by the intended deception was\\ninstantly appeased, and he began to collect his thoughts, in order to\\nenact his part with suitable spirit, when he found he was about to be\\nanticipated in his skill by an attempt to prove the power of music.\\n\\nGamut, who had stood prepared to pour forth his spirit in song when the\\nvisitors entered, after delaying a moment, drew a strain from his pipe,\\nand commenced a hymn that might have worked a miracle, had faith in its\\nefficacy been of much avail. He was allowed to proceed to the close, the\\nIndians respecting his imaginary infirmity, and Duncan too glad of the\\ndelay to hazard the slightest interruption. As the dying cadence of his\\nstrains was falling on the ears of the latter, he started aside at\\nhearing them repeated behind him in a voice half human, half\\nsepulchral. Looking around, he beheld the shaggy monster seated on end\\nin a shadow of the cavern, where, while his restless body swung in the\\nuneasy manner of the animal, it repeated, in a sort of low growl, sound,\\nif not words, which bore some slight resemblance to the melody of the\\nsinger.\\n\\nThe effect of so strange an echo on David may better be imagined than\\ndescribed. His eyes opened as if he doubted their truth; and his voice\\nbecame instantly mute in excess of wonder. A deep-laid scheme, of\\ncommunicating some important intelligence to Heyward, was driven from\\nhis recollection by an emotion which very nearly resembled fear, but\\nwhich he was fain to believe was admiration. Under its influence, he\\nexclaimed aloud--\"She expects you, and is at hand;\" and precipitately\\nleft the cavern.\\n\\n\\n\\n'"
