Though it is the last war that England and France waged for a country that neither would retain, the wilderness between the forces still has to be overcome first. Thus it is in 1757, in the New York area between the head waters of the Hudson River and Lake George to the north. Because only two years earlier General Braddock was disgracefully routed by a handful of French and Indians, the frontier is now exposed to real and imaginary savage disasters as well as to the horrors of warfare. Fear has replaced reason. Near dusk of a day in July, an Indian runner named Magua arrives at Fort Edward on the upper Hudson. He has come from Fort William Henry at the southern tip of Lake George with the news that the French General Montcalm is moving south with a very large army and that Munro, commander of Fort William Henry, is in urgent need of plentiful reinforcements from General Webb. Early the next morning, a limited detachment of fifteen hundred regulars and colonists departs as if swallowed by the forest. Shortly afterwards, Major Duncan Heyward and Alice and Cora Munro, guided by Magua on foot, take by horseback a secret route toward William Henry for the girls to join their father. Blonde Alice is doubtful about Magua, covered with war paint and showing a sullen fierceness; but dark-haired Cora is stoically common sense about him, even though Heyward mentions that their father had once had to deal rigidly with the Indian. As the small party pushes on, they are overtaken by David Gamut, a tall, ungainly psalmodist ridiculously dressed and carrying a pitch pipe while riding a mare followed by its young colt. He desires to join them, and after some banter between him and Alice, he pulls out the twenty-sixth edition of The Bay Psalm Book, sounds his pipe, and renders a song \\\\\"in full, sweet, and melodious tones.\\\\\" At a muttered comment from Magua, Heyward insists upon silence for safety. Then he glances about them and, satisfied that he has seen only shining berries, smiles to himself as they move on. But he is wrong. The branches move and a man peers exultingly after them as they disappear among the dark lines of trees.\", \"analysis\": \"These two chapters introduce the reader to the historical and natural settings and are indicative of the extent to which this book, as a historical novel, relates its fictional characters to real history. Only here at the beginning and later at mid-novel will the action coincide in detail with actual events, though the historic war is always somewhere in the near distance. These chapters also present four of the main fictional characters and one secondary one, all of whom will merit our concern henceforth. Major Heyward is the gallant romantic hero, but unlike most sentimental romances where for each hero there is one heroine, here there are two, Alice and Cora, blonde and brunette. And it is immediately apparent that the old tradition of weak-blonde-strong-brunette contrast is at work, stereotyping the fair Alice and dark Cora. These three are rather predictable types which both simplify and stultify the writer\\'s efforts with them. Magua\\'s stealthy eyes and abrupt, furtive actions mark him as a potential villain, while the exaggerated presentation of the simple, single-minded Gamut paints him as the comic and perhaps pitiable adult innocent. At this point, both are something less than realistic and fully vitalized characters, but in comparison to the other three they seem to breathe real air. The stature of originality and verisimilitude that they do show is doubtless due to the fact that they are native characters. One may note, for instance, that Heyward\\'s comment about Munro\\'s once dealing rigidly with Magua not only lends suspense to the situation and points to the theme of revenge but also suggests some depth of motivation for the Indian. What we call plot -- the complications of a situation and the subsequent events and actions that further entangle things before they are finally resolved in some fashion -- starts an early ferment in terms of danger and suspense. Four likable and somewhat innocent characters strike into the unknown forest wilderness with a doubtful guide. It is a time of urgency, and movement is swift. Cooper hardly gives the reader time to question seriously why Munro\\'s daughters would push forward their visit at this worst of times and would feel themselves safer almost alone on a dim path in savage-infested territory than in the company of fifteen hundred trained fighting men. This represents a lack in character motivation, but Cooper knows that he must get his people into jeopardy, and he at least partly succeeds in hiding this lack under suspenseful action and a sense of urgency. But in spite of the pace, Cooper also manages a good instance of dramatic irony, a fictional presentation in which the reader is allowed to see or deduce predicaments unknown or only partly known by the characters. It is thus that the first part of the pattern of action -- that of pursuit -- has begun.\"}',\n",
       "    'chapter': '\\n  \"Mine ear is open, and my heart prepared:\\n  The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold:\\n  Say, is my kingdom lost?\"\\n\\n  SHAKESPEARE.\\n\\n\\nIt was a feature peculiar to the colonial wars of North America, that\\nthe toils and dangers of the wilderness were to be encountered before\\nthe adverse hosts could meet. A wide and apparently an impervious\\nboundary of forests severed the possessions of the hostile provinces of\\nFrance and England. The hardy colonist, and the trained European who\\nfought at his side, frequently expended months in struggling against the\\nrapids of the streams, or in effecting the rugged passes of the\\nmountains, in quest of an opportunity to exhibit their courage in a more\\nmartial conflict. But, emulating the patience and self-denial of the\\npractised native warriors, they learned to overcome every difficulty;\\nand it would seem that, in time, there was no recess of the woods so\\ndark, nor any secret place so lovely, that it might claim exemption from\\nthe inroads of those who had pledged their blood to satiate their\\nvengeance, or to uphold the cold and selfish policy of the distant\\nmonarchs of Europe.\\n\\nPerhaps no district throughout the wide extent of the intermediate\\nfrontiers can furnish a livelier picture of the cruelty and fierceness\\nof the savage warfare of those periods than the country which lies\\nbetween the head waters of the Hudson and the adjacent lakes.\\n\\nThe facilities which nature had there offered to the march of the\\ncombatants were too obvious to be neglected. The lengthened sheet of the\\nChamplain stretched from the frontiers of Canada, deep within the\\nborders of the neighboring province of New York, forming a natural\\npassage across half the distance that the French were compelled to\\nmaster in order to strike their enemies. Near its southern termination,\\nit received the contributions of another lake, whose waters were so\\nlimpid as to have been exclusively selected by the Jesuit missionaries\\nto perform the typical purification of baptism, and to obtain for it the\\ntitle of lake \"du Saint Sacrement.\" The less zealous English thought\\nthey conferred a sufficient honor on its unsullied fountains, when they\\nbestowed the name of their reigning prince, the second of the house of\\nHanover. The two united to rob the untutored possessors of its wooded\\nscenery of their native right to perpetuate its original appellation of\\n\"Horican.\"[1]\\n\\nWinding its way among countless islands, and imbedded in mountains, the\\n\"holy lake\" extended a dozen leagues still farther to the south. With\\nthe high plain that there interposed itself to the further passage of\\nthe water, commenced a portage of as many miles, which conducted the\\nadventurer to the banks of the Hudson, at a point where, with the usual\\nobstructions of the rapids, or rifts, as they were then termed in the\\nlanguage of the country, the river became navigable to the tide.\\n\\nWhile, in the pursuit of their daring plans of annoyance, the restless\\nenterprise of the French even attempted the distant and difficult gorges\\nof the Alleghany, it may easily be imagined that their proverbial\\nacuteness would not overlook the natural advantages of the district we\\nhave just described. It became, emphatically, the bloody arena, in which\\nmost of the battles for the mastery of the colonies were contested.\\nForts were erected at the different points that commanded the facilities\\nof the route, and were taken and retaken, razed and rebuilt, as victory\\nalighted on the hostile banners. While the husbandman shrank back from\\nthe dangerous passes, within the safer boundaries of the more ancient\\nsettlements, armies larger than those that had often disposed of the\\nsceptres of the mother countries, were seen to bury themselves in these\\nforests, whence they rarely returned but in skeleton bands, that were\\nhaggard with care, or dejected by defeat. Though the arts of peace were\\nunknown to this fatal region, its forests were alive with men; its\\nshades and glens rang with the sounds of martial music, and the echoes\\nof its mountains threw back the laugh, or repeated the wanton cry, of\\nmany a gallant and reckless youth, as he hurried by them, in the\\nnoontide of his spirits, to slumber in a long night of forgetfulness.\\n\\nIt was in this scene of strife and bloodshed that the incidents we shall\\nattempt to relate occurred, during the third year of the war which\\nEngland and France last waged for the possession of a country that\\nneither was destined to retain.\\n\\nThe imbecility of her military leaders abroad, and the fatal want of\\nenergy in her councils at home, had lowered the character of Great\\nBritain from the proud elevation on which it had been placed, by the\\ntalents and enterprise of her former warriors and statesmen. No longer\\ndreaded by her enemies, her servants were fast losing the confidence of\\nself-respect. In this mortifying abasement, the colonists, though\\ninnocent of her imbecility, and too humble to be the agents of her\\nblunders, were but the natural participators.\\n\\nThey had recently seen a chosen army from that country, which,\\nreverencing as a mother, they had blindly believed invincible--an army\\nled by a chief who had been selected from a crowd of trained warriors,\\nfor his rare military endowments, disgracefully routed by a handful of\\nFrench and Indians, and only saved from annihilation by the coolness and\\nspirit of a Virginian boy, whose riper fame has since diffused itself,\\nwith the steady influence of moral truth, to the uttermost confines of\\nChristendom.[2] A wide frontier had been laid naked by this unexpected\\ndisaster, and more substantial evils were preceded by a thousand\\nfanciful and imaginary dangers. The alarmed colonists believed that the\\nyells of the savages mingled with every fitful gust of wind that issued\\nfrom the interminable forests of the west. The terrific character of\\ntheir merciless enemies increased immeasurably the natural horrors of\\nwarfare. Numberless recent massacres were still vivid in their\\nrecollections; nor was there any ear in the provinces so deaf as not to\\nhave drunk in with avidity the narrative of some fearful tale of\\nmidnight murder, in which the natives of the forests were the principal\\nand barbarous actors. As the credulous and excited traveller related the\\nhazardous chances of the wilderness, the blood of the timid curdled\\nwith terror, and mothers cast anxious glances even at those children\\nwhich slumbered within the security of the largest towns. In short, the\\nmagnifying influence of fear began to set at naught the calculations of\\nreason, and to render those who should have remembered their manhood,\\nthe slaves of the basest of passions. Even the most confident and the\\nstoutest hearts began to think the issue of the contest was becoming\\ndoubtful; and that abject class was hourly increasing in numbers, who\\nthought they foresaw all the possessions of the English crown in America\\nsubdued by their Christian foes, or laid waste by the inroads of their\\nrelentless allies.\\n\\nWhen, therefore, intelligence was received at the fort, which covered\\nthe southern termination of the portage between the Hudson and the\\nlakes, that Montcalm had been seen moving up the Champlain, with an army\\n\"numerous as the leaves on the trees,\" its truth was admitted with more\\nof the craven reluctance of fear than with the stern joy that a warrior\\nshould feel, in finding an enemy within reach of his blow. The news had\\nbeen brought, towards the decline of a day in midsummer, by an Indian\\nrunner, who also bore an urgent request from Munro, the commander of a\\nwork on the shore of the \"holy lake,\" for a speedy and powerful\\nreinforcement. It has already been mentioned that the distance between\\nthese two posts was less than five leagues. The rude path, which\\noriginally formed their line of communication, had been widened for the\\npassage of wagons; so that the distance which had been travelled by the\\nson of the forest in two hours, might easily be effected by a detachment\\nof troops, with their necessary baggage, between the rising and setting\\nof a summer sun. The loyal servants of the British crown had given to\\none of these forest fastnesses the name of William Henry, and to the\\nother that of Fort Edward; calling each after a favorite prince of the\\nreigning family. The veteran Scotchman just named held the first, with a\\nregiment of regulars and a few provincials; a force really by far too\\nsmall to make head against the formidable power that Montcalm was\\nleading to the foot of his earthen mounds. At the latter, however, lay\\nGeneral Webb, who commanded the armies of the king in the northern\\nprovinces, with a body of more than five thousand men. By uniting the\\nseveral detachments of his command, this officer might have arrayed\\nnearly double that number of combatants against the enterprising\\nFrenchman, who had ventured so far from his reinforcements, with an army\\nbut little superior in numbers.\\n\\nBut under the influence of their degraded fortunes, both officers and\\nmen appeared better disposed to await the approach of their formidable\\nantagonists, within their works, than to resist the progress of their\\nmarch, by emulating the successful example of the French at Fort du\\nQuesne, and striking a blow on their advance.\\n\\nAfter the first surprise of the intelligence had a little abated, a\\nrumor was spread through the entrenched camp, which stretched along the\\nmargin of the Hudson, forming a chain of outworks to the body of the\\nfort itself, that a chosen detachment of fifteen hundred men was to\\ndepart, with the dawn, for William Henry, the post at the northern\\nextremity of the portage. That which at first was only rumor, soon\\nbecame certainty, as orders passed from the quarters of the\\ncommander-in-chief to the several corps he had selected for this\\nservice, to prepare for their speedy departure. All doubt as to the\\nintention of Webb now vanished, and an hour or two of hurried footsteps\\nand anxious faces succeeded. The novice in the military art flew from\\npoint to point, retarding his own preparations by the excess of his\\nviolent and somewhat distempered zeal; while the more practised veteran\\nmade his arrangements with a deliberation that scorned every appearance\\nof haste; though his sober lineaments and anxious eye sufficiently\\nbetrayed that he had no very strong professional relish for the as yet\\nuntried and dreaded warfare of the wilderness. At length the sun set in\\na flood of glory, behind the distant western hills, and as darkness drew\\nits veil around the secluded spot the sounds of preparation diminished;\\nthe last light finally disappeared from the log cabin of some officer;\\nthe trees cast their deeper shadows over the mounds and the rippling\\nstream, and a silence soon pervaded the camp, as deep as that which\\nreigned in the vast forest by which it was environed.\\n\\nAccording to the orders of the preceding night, the heavy sleep of the\\narmy was broken by the rolling of the warning drums, whose rattling\\nechoes were heard issuing, on the damp morning air, out of every vista\\nof the woods, just as day began to draw the shaggy outlines of some tall\\npines of the vicinity, on the opening brightness of a soft and cloudless\\neastern sky. In an instant the whole camp was in motion; the meanest\\nsoldier arousing from his lair to witness the departure of his\\ncomrades, and to share in the excitement and incidents of the hour. The\\nsimple array of the chosen band was soon completed. While the regular\\nand trained hirelings of the king marched with haughtiness to the right\\nof the line, the less pretending colonists took their humbler position\\non its left, with a docility that long practice had rendered easy. The\\nscouts departed; strong guards preceded and followed the lumbering\\nvehicles that bore the baggage; and before the gray light of the morning\\nwas mellowed by the rays of the sun, the main body of the combatants\\nwheeled into column, and left the encampment with a show of high\\nmilitary bearing, that served to drown the slumbering apprehensions of\\nmany a novice, who was now about to make his first essay in arms. While\\nin view of their admiring comrades, the same proud front and ordered\\narray was observed, until the notes of their fifes growing fainter in\\ndistance, the forest at length appeared to swallow up the living mass\\nwhich had slowly entered its bosom.\\n\\nThe deepest sounds of the retiring and invisible column had ceased to be\\nborne on the breeze to the listeners, and the latest straggler had\\nalready disappeared in pursuit; but there still remained the signs of\\nanother departure, before a log cabin of unusual size and\\naccommodations, in front of which those sentinels paced their rounds,\\nwho were known to guard the person of the English general. At this spot\\nwere gathered some half dozen horses, caparisoned in a manner which\\nshowed that two, at least, were destined to bear the persons of females,\\nof a rank that it was not usual to meet so far in the wilds of the\\ncountry. A third wore the trappings and arms of an officer of the staff;\\nwhile the rest, from the plainness of the housings, and the travelling\\nmails with which they were encumbered, were evidently fitted for the\\nreception of as many menials, who were, seemingly, already awaiting the\\npleasure of those they served. At a respectful distance from this\\nunusual show were gathered divers groups of curious idlers; some\\nadmiring the blood and bone of the high-mettled military charger, and\\nothers gazing at the preparations, with dull wonder of vulgar curiosity.\\nThere was one man, however, who, by his countenance and actions, formed\\na marked exception to those who composed the latter class of spectators,\\nbeing neither idle, nor seemingly very ignorant.\\n\\nThe person of this individual was to the last degree ungainly, without\\nbeing in any particular manner deformed. He had all the bones and joints\\nof other men, without any of their proportions. Erect, his stature\\nsurpassed that of his fellows; seated, he appeared reduced within the\\nordinary limits of the race. The same contrariety in his members seemed\\nto exist throughout the whole man. His head was large; his shoulders\\nnarrow; his arms long and dangling; while his hands were small, if not\\ndelicate. His legs and thighs were thin, nearly to emaciation, but of\\nextraordinary length; and his knees would have been considered\\ntremendous, had they not been outdone by the broader foundations on\\nwhich this false superstructure of the blended human orders was so\\nprofanely reared. The ill-assorted and injudicious attire of the\\nindividual only served to render his awkwardness more conspicuous. A\\nsky-blue coat, with short and broad skirts and low cape, exposed a long\\nthin neck, and longer and thinner legs, to the worst animadversions of\\nthe evil disposed. His nether garment was of yellow nankeen, closely\\nfitted to the shape, and tied at his bunches of knees by large knots of\\nwhite ribbon, a good deal sullied by use. Clouded cotton stockings, and\\nshoes, on one of the latter of which was a plated spur, completed the\\ncostume of the lower extremity of this figure, no curve or angle of\\nwhich was concealed, but, on the other hand, studiously exhibited,\\nthrough the vanity or simplicity of its owner. From beneath the flap of\\nan enormous pocket of a soiled vest of embossed silk, heavily ornamented\\nwith tarnished silver lace, projected an instrument, which, from being\\nseen in such martial company, might have been easily mistaken for some\\nmischievous and unknown implement of war. Small as it was, this uncommon\\nengine had excited the curiosity of most of the Europeans in the camp,\\nthough several of the provincials were seen to handle it, not only\\nwithout fear, but with the utmost familiarity. A large, civil cocked\\nhat, like those worn by clergymen within the last thirty years,\\nsurmounted the whole, furnishing dignity to a good-natured and somewhat\\nvacant countenance, that apparently needed such artificial aid, to\\nsupport the gravity of some high and extraordinary trust.\\n\\nWhile the common herd stood aloof, in deference to the quarters of Webb,\\nthe figure we have described stalked in the centre of the domestics,\\nfreely expressing his censures or commendations on the merits of the\\nhorses, as by chance they displeased or satisfied his judgment.\\n\\n\"This beast, I rather conclude, friend, is not of home raising, but is\\nfrom foreign lands, or perhaps from the little island itself over the\\nblue water?\" he said, in a voice as remarkable for the softness and\\nsweetness of its tones, as was his person for its rare proportions: \"I\\nmay speak of these things, and be no braggart; for I have been down at\\nboth havens; that which is situate at the mouth of Thames, and is named\\nafter the capital of Old England, and that which is called \\'Haven,\\' with\\nthe addition of the word \\'New\\'; and have seen the snows and brigantines\\ncollecting their droves, like the gathering to the ark, being outward\\nbound to the Island of Jamaica, for the purpose of barter and traffic in\\nfour-footed animals; but never before have I beheld a beast which\\nverified the true Scripture war-horse like this: \\'He paweth in the\\nvalley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth on to meet the armed\\nmen. He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle\\nafar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.\\' It would seem\\nthat the stock of the horse of Israel has descended to our own time;\\nwould it not, friend?\"\\n\\nReceiving no reply to this extraordinary appeal, which in truth, as it\\nwas delivered with the vigor of full and sonorous tones, merited some\\nsort of notice, he who had thus sung forth the language of the Holy Book\\nturned to the silent figure to whom he had unwittingly addressed\\nhimself, and found a new and more powerful subject of admiration in the\\nobject that encountered his gaze. His eyes fell on the still, upright,\\nand rigid form of the \"Indian runner,\" who had borne to the camp the\\nunwelcome tidings of the preceding evening. Although in a state of\\nperfect repose, and apparently disregarding, with characteristic\\nstoicism, the excitement and bustle around him, there was a sullen\\nfierceness mingled with the quiet of the savage, that was likely to\\narrest the attention of much more experienced eyes than those which now\\nscanned him, in unconcealed amazement. The native bore both the tomahawk\\nand knife of his tribe; and yet his appearance was not altogether that\\nof a warrior. On the contrary, there was an air of neglect about his\\nperson, like that which might have proceeded from great and recent\\nexertion, which he had not yet found leisure to repair. The colors of\\nthe war-paint had blended in dark confusion about his fierce\\ncountenance, and rendered his swarthy lineaments still more savage and\\nrepulsive than if art had attempted an effect which had been thus\\nproduced by chance. His eye, alone, which glistened like a fiery star\\namid lowering clouds, was to be seen in its state of native wildness.\\nFor a single instant, his searching and yet wary glance met the\\nwondering look of the other, and then changing its direction, partly in\\ncunning, and partly in disdain, it remained fixed, as if penetrating the\\ndistant air.\\n\\nIt is impossible to say what unlooked-for remark this short and silent\\ncommunication, between two such singular men, might have elicited from\\nthe white man, had not his active curiosity been again drawn to other\\nobjects. A general movement among the domestics, and a low sound of\\ngentle voices, announced the approach of those whose presence alone was\\nwanted to enable the cavalcade to move. The simple admirer of the\\nwar-horse instantly fell back to a low, gaunt, switch-tailed mare, that\\nwas unconsciously gleaning the faded herbage of the camp nigh by; where,\\nleaning with one elbow on the blanket that concealed an apology for a\\nsaddle, he became a spectator of the departure, while a foal was quietly\\nmaking its morning repast, on the opposite side of the same animal.\\n\\nA young man, in the dress of an officer, conducted to their steeds two\\nfemales, who, as it was apparent by their dresses, were prepared to\\nencounter the fatigues of a journey in the woods. One, and she was the\\nmost juvenile in her appearance, though both were young, permitted\\nglimpses of her dazzling complexion, fair golden hair, and bright blue\\neyes, to be caught, as she artlessly suffered the morning air to blow\\naside the green veil which descended low from her beaver. The flush\\nwhich still lingered above the pines in the western sky was not more\\nbright nor delicate than the bloom on her cheek; nor was the opening day\\nmore cheering than the animated smile which she bestowed on the youth,\\nas he assisted her into the saddle. The other, who appeared to share\\nequally in the attentions of the young officer, concealed her charms\\nfrom the gaze of the soldiery, with a care that seemed better fitted to\\nthe experience of four or five additional years. It could be seen,\\nhowever, that her person, though moulded with the same exquisite\\nproportions, of which none of the graces were lost by the travelling\\ndress she wore, was rather fuller and more mature than that of her\\ncompanion.\\n\\nNo sooner were these females seated, than their attendant sprang lightly\\ninto the saddle of the war-horse, when the whole three bowed to Webb,\\nwho, in courtesy, awaited their parting on the threshold of his cabin,\\nand turning their horses\\' heads, they proceeded at a slow amble,\\nfollowed by their train, towards the northern entrance of the\\nencampment. As they traversed that short distance, not a voice was\\nheard amongst them; but a slight exclamation proceeded from the younger\\nof the females, as the Indian runner glided by her, unexpectedly, and\\nled the way along the military road in her front. Though this sudden and\\nstartling movement of the Indian produced no sound from the other, in\\nthe surprise her veil also was allowed to open its folds, and betrayed\\nan indescribable look of pity, admiration, and horror, as her dark eye\\nfollowed the easy motions of the savage. The tresses of this lady were\\nshining and black, like the plumage of the raven. Her complexion was not\\nbrown, but it rather appeared charged with the color of the rich blood,\\nthat seemed ready to burst its bounds. And yet there was neither\\ncoarseness nor want of shadowing in a countenance that was exquisitely\\nregular and dignified, and surpassingly beautiful. She smiled, as if in\\npity at her own momentary forgetfulness, discovering by the act a row of\\nteeth that would have shamed the purest ivory; when, replacing the veil,\\nshe bowed her face, and rode in silence, like one whose thoughts were\\nabstracted from the scene around her.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \"Sola, sola, wo, ha, ho, sola!\"\\n\\n  SHAKESPEARE.\\n\\n\\nWhile one of the lovely beings we have so cursorily presented to the\\nreader was thus lost in thought, the other quickly recovered from the\\nalarm which induced the exclamation, and, laughing at her own weakness,\\nshe inquired of the youth who rode by her side,--\\n\\n\"Are such spectres frequent in the woods, Heyward; or is this sight an\\nespecial entertainment on our behalf? If the latter, gratitude must\\nclose our mouths; but if the former, both Cora and I shall have need to\\ndraw largely on that stock of hereditary courage which we boast, even\\nbefore we are made to encounter the redoubtable Montcalm.\"\\n\\n\"Yon Indian is a \\'runner\\' of the army; and, after the fashion of his\\npeople, he may be accounted a hero,\" returned the officer. \"He has\\nvolunteered to guide us to the lake, by a path but little known, sooner\\nthan if we followed the tardy movements of the column: and, by\\nconsequence, more agreeably.\"\\n\\n\"I like him not,\" said the lady, shuddering, partly in assumed, yet more\\nin real terror. \"You know him, Duncan, or you would not trust yourself\\nso freely to his keeping?\"\\n\\n\"Say, rather, Alice, that I would not trust you. I do know him, or he\\nwould not have my confidence, and least of all at this moment. He is\\nsaid to be a Canadian, too; and yet he served with our friends the\\nMohawks, who, as you know, are one of the six allied nations.[3] He was\\nbrought among us, as I have heard, by some strange accident in which\\nyour father was interested, and in which the savage was rigidly dealt\\nby--but I forget the idle tale; it is enough, that he is now our\\nfriend.\"\\n\\n\"If he has been my father\\'s enemy, I like him still less!\" exclaimed the\\nnow really anxious girl. \"Will you not speak to him, Major Heyward, that\\nI may hear his tones? Foolish though it may be, you have often heard me\\navow my faith in the tones of the human voice!\"\\n\\n\"It would be in vain; and answered, most probably, by an ejaculation.\\nThough he may understand it, he affects, like most of his people, to be\\nignorant of the English; and least of all will he condescend to speak\\nit, now that war demands the utmost exercise of his dignity. But he\\nstops; the private path by which we are to journey is, doubtless, at\\nhand.\"\\n\\nThe conjecture of Major Heyward was true. When they reached the spot\\nwhere the Indian stood, pointing into the thicket that fringed the\\nmilitary road, a narrow and blind path, which might, with some little\\ninconvenience, receive one person at a time, became visible.\\n\\n\"Here, then, lies our way,\" said the young man, in a low voice.\\n\"Manifest no distrust, or you may invite the danger you appear to\\napprehend.\"\\n\\n\"Cora, what think you?\" asked the reluctant fair one. \"If we journey\\nwith the troops, though we may find their presence irksome, shall we not\\nfeel better assurance of our safety?\"\\n\\n\"Being little accustomed to the practices of the savages, Alice, you\\nmistake the place of real danger,\" said Heyward. \"If enemies have\\nreached the portage at all, a thing by no means probable, as our scouts\\nare abroad, they will surely be found skirting the column where scalps\\nabound the most. The route of the detachment is known, while ours,\\nhaving been determined within the hour, must still be secret.\"\\n\\n\"Should we distrust the man because his manners are not our manners, and\\nthat his skin is dark?\" coldly asked Cora.\\n\\nAlice hesitated no longer; but giving her Narragansett[4] a smart cut\\nof the whip, she was the first to dash aside the slight branches of the\\nbushes, and to follow the runner along the dark and tangled pathway. The\\nyoung man regarded the last speaker in open admiration, and even\\npermitted her fairer though certainly not more beautiful companion to\\nproceed unattended, while he sedulously opened the way himself for the\\npassage of her who has been called Cora. It would seem that the\\ndomestics had been previously instructed; for, instead of penetrating\\nthe thicket, they followed the route of the column; a measure which\\nHeyward stated had been dictated by the sagacity of their guide, in\\norder to diminish the marks of their trail, if, haply, the Canadian\\nsavages should be lurking so far in advance of their army. For many\\nminutes the intricacy of the route admitted of no further dialogue;\\nafter which they emerged from the broad border of underbrush which grew\\nalong the line of the highway, and entered under the high but dark\\narches of the forest. Here their progress was less interrupted, and the\\ninstant the guide perceived that the females could command their steeds,\\nhe moved on, at a pace between a trot and a walk, and at a rate which\\nkept the sure-footed and peculiar animals they rode, at a fast yet easy\\namble. The youth had turned to speak to the dark-eyed Cora, when the\\ndistant sound of horses\\' hoofs, clattering over the roots of the broken\\nway in his rear, caused him to check his charger; and, as his companions\\ndrew their reins at the same instant, the whole party came to a halt, in\\norder to obtain an explanation of the unlooked-for interruption.\\n\\nIn a few moments a colt was seen gliding, like a fallow-deer, among the\\nstraight trunks of the pines; and, in another instant, the person of the\\nungainly man described in the preceding chapter, came into view, with as\\nmuch rapidity as he could excite his meagre beast to endure without\\ncoming to an open rupture. Until now this personage had escaped the\\nobservation of the travellers. If he possessed the power to arrest any\\nwandering eye when exhibiting the glories of his altitude on foot, his\\nequestrian graces were still more likely to attract attention.\\nNotwithstanding a constant application of his one armed heel to the\\nflanks of the mare, the most confirmed gait that he could establish was\\na Canterbury gallop with the hind legs, in which those more forward\\nassisted for doubtful moments, though generally content to maintain a\\nloping trot. Perhaps the rapidity of the changes from one of these paces\\nto the other created an optical illusion, which might thus magnify the\\npowers of the beast; for it is certain that Heyward, who possessed a\\ntrue eye for the merits of a horse, was unable, with his utmost\\ningenuity, to decide by what sort of movement his pursuer worked his\\nsinuous way on his footsteps with such persevering hardihood.\\n\\nThe industry and movements of the rider were not less remarkable than\\nthose of the ridden. At each change in the evolutions of the latter, the\\nformer raised his tall person in the stirrups; producing, in this\\nmanner, by the undue elongation of his legs, such sudden growths and\\ndiminishings of the stature, as baffled every conjecture that might be\\nmade as to his dimensions. If to this be added the fact that, in\\nconsequence of the ex parte application of the spur, one side of the\\nmare appeared to journey faster than the other; and that the aggrieved\\nflank was resolutely indicated by unremitted flourishes of a bushy tail,\\nwe finish the picture of both horse and man.\\n\\nThe frown which had gathered around the handsome, open, and manly brow\\nof Heyward, gradually relaxed, and his lips curled into a slight smile,\\nas he regarded the stranger. Alice made no very powerful effort to\\ncontrol her merriment; and even the dark, thoughtful eye of Cora lighted\\nwith a humor that, it would seem, the habit, rather than the nature of\\nits mistress repressed.\\n\\n\"Seek you any here?\" demanded Heyward, when the other had arrived\\nsufficiently nigh to abate his speed; \"I trust you are no messenger of\\nevil tidings?\"\\n\\n\"Even so,\" replied the stranger, making diligent use of his triangular\\ncastor, to produce a circulation in the close air of the woods, and\\nleaving his hearers in doubt to which of the young man\\'s questions he\\nresponded; when, however, he had cooled his face, and recovered his\\nbreath, he continued, \"I hear you are riding to William Henry; as I am\\njourneying thitherward myself, I concluded good company would seem\\nconsistent to the wishes of both parties.\"\\n\\n\"You appear to possess the privilege of a casting vote,\" returned\\nHeyward; \"we are three, whilst you have consulted no one but yourself.\"\\n\\n\"Even so. The first point to be obtained is to know one\\'s own mind. Once\\nsure of that, and where women are concerned, it is not easy, the next\\nis, to act up to the decision. I have endeavored to do both, and here I\\nam.\"\\n\\n\"If you journey to the lake, you have mistaken your route,\" said\\nHeyward, haughtily; \"the highway thither is at least half a mile behind\\nyou.\"\\n\\n\"Even so,\" returned the stranger, nothing daunted by this cold\\nreception; \"I have tarried at \\'Edward\\' a week, and I should be dumb not\\nto have inquired the road I was to journey; and if dumb there would be\\nan end to my calling.\" After simpering in a small way, like one whose\\nmodesty prohibited a more open expression of his admiration of a\\nwitticism that was perfectly unintelligible to his hearers, he\\ncontinued: \"It is not prudent for any one of my profession to be too\\nfamiliar with those he is to instruct; for which reason I follow not the\\nline of the army; besides which, I conclude that a gentleman of your\\ncharacter has the best judgment in matters of wayfaring; I have\\ntherefore decided to join company, in order that the ride may be made\\nagreeable, and partake of social communion.\"\\n\\n\"A most arbitrary, if not a hasty decision!\" exclaimed Heyward,\\nundecided whether to give vent to his growing anger, or to laugh in the\\nother\\'s face. \"But you speak of instruction, and of a profession; are\\nyou an adjunct to the provincial corps, as a master of the noble science\\nof defence and offence; or, perhaps, you are one who draws lines and\\nangles, under the pretence of expounding the mathematics?\"\\n\\nThe stranger regarded his interrogator a moment, in wonder; and then,\\nlosing every mark of self-satisfaction in an expression of solemn\\nhumility, he answered:--\\n\\n\"Of offence, I hope there is none, to either party: of defence, I make\\nnone--by God\\'s good mercy, having committed no palpable sin since last\\nentreating his pardoning grace. I understand not your allusions about\\nlines and angles; and I leave expounding to those who have been called\\nand set apart for that holy office. I lay claim to no higher gift than a\\nsmall insight into the glorious art of petitioning and thanksgiving, as\\npractised in psalmody.\"\\n\\n\"The man is, most manifestly, a disciple of Apollo,\" cried the amused\\nAlice, \"and I take him under my own especial protection. Nay, throw\\naside that frown, Heyward, and in pity to my longing ears, suffer him to\\njourney in our train. Besides,\" she added, in a low and hurried voice,\\ncasting a glance at the distant Cora, who slowly followed the footsteps\\nof their silent but sullen guide, \"it may be a friend added to our\\nstrength, in time of need.\"\\n\\n\"Think you, Alice, that I would trust those I love by this secret path,\\ndid I imagine such need could happen?\"\\n\\n\"Nay, nay, I think not of it now; but this strange man amuses me; and if\\nhe \\'hath music in his soul,\\' let us not churlishly reject his company.\"\\nShe pointed persuasively along the path with her riding-whip, while\\ntheir eyes met in a look which the young man lingered a moment to\\nprolong; then yielding to her gentle influence, he clapped his spurs\\ninto his charger, and in a few bounds was again at the side of Cora.\\n\\n\"I am glad to encounter thee, friend,\" continued the maiden, waving her\\nhand to the stranger to proceed, as she urged her Narragansett to renew\\nits amble. \"Partial relatives have almost persuaded me that I am not\\nentirely worthless in a duet myself; and we may enliven our wayfaring by\\nindulging in our favorite pursuit. It might be of signal advantage to\\none, ignorant as I, to hear the opinions and experience of a master in\\nthe art.\"\\n\\n\"It is refreshing both to the spirits and to the body to indulge in\\npsalmody, in befitting seasons,\" returned the master of song,\\nunhesitatingly complying with her intimation to follow; \"and nothing\\nwould relieve the mind more than such a consoling communion. But four\\nparts are altogether necessary to the perfection of melody. You have all\\nthe manifestations of a soft and rich treble; I can, by especial aid,\\ncarry a full tenor to the highest letter; but we lack counter and bass!\\nYon officer of the king, who hesitated to admit me to his company, might\\nfill the latter, if one may judge from the intonations of his voice in\\ncommon dialogue.\"\\n\\n\"Judge not too rashly from hasty and deceptive appearances,\" said the\\nlady, smiling; \"though Major Heyward can assume such deep notes on\\noccasion, believe me, his natural tones are better fitted for a mellow\\ntenor than the bass you heard.\"\\n\\n\"Is he, then, much practised in the art of psalmody?\" demanded her\\nsimple companion.\\n\\nAlice felt disposed to laugh, though she succeeded in suppressing her\\nmerriment, ere she answered,--\\n\\n\"I apprehend that he is rather addicted to profane song. The chances of\\na soldier\\'s life are but little fitted for the encouragement of more\\nsober inclinations.\"\\n\\n\"Man\\'s voice is given to him, like his other talents, to be used, and\\nnot to be abused. None can say they have ever known me neglect my gifts!\\nI am thankful that, though my boyhood may be said to have been set\\napart, like the youth of the royal David, for the purposes of music, no\\nsyllable of rude verse has ever profaned my lips.\"\\n\\n\"You have, then, limited your efforts to sacred song?\"\\n\\n\"Even so. As the psalms of David exceed all other language, so does the\\npsalmody that has been fitted to them by the divines and sages of the\\nland, surpass all vain poetry. Happily, I may say that I utter nothing\\nbut the thoughts and the wishes of the King of Israel himself; for\\nthough the times may call for some slight changes, yet does this version\\nwhich we use in the colonies of New England, so much exceed all other\\nversions, that, by its richness, its exactness, and its spiritual\\nsimplicity, it approacheth, as near as may be, to the great work of the\\ninspired writer. I never abide in any place, sleeping or waking, without\\nan example of this gifted work. \\'Tis the six-and-twentieth edition,\\npromulgated at Boston, Anno Domini 1744; and is entitled, _The Psalms,\\nHymns, and Spiritual Songs of the Old and New Testaments; faithfully\\ntranslated into English Metre, for the Use, Edification, and Comfort of\\nthe Saints, in Public and Private, especially in New England_.\"\\n\\nDuring this eulogium on the rare production of his native poets, the\\nstranger had drawn the book from his pocket, and, fitting a pair of\\niron-rimmed spectacles to his nose, opened the volume with a care and\\nveneration suited to its sacred purposes. Then, without circumlocution\\nor apology, first pronouncing the word \"Standish,\" and placing the\\nunknown engine, already described, to his mouth, from which he drew a\\nhigh, shrill sound, that was followed by an octave below, from his own\\nvoice, he commenced singing the following words, in full, sweet, and\\nmelodious tones, that set the music, the poetry, and even the uneasy\\nmotion of his ill-trained beast at defiance:--\\n\\n  \"How good it is, O see,\\n    And how it pleaseth well,\\n  Together, e\\'en in unity,\\n    For brethren so to dwell.\\n  It\\'s like the choice ointment,\\n    From the head to the beard did go:\\n  Down Aaron\\'s beard, that downward went,\\n    His garment\\'s skirts unto.\"\\n\\nThe delivery of these skilful rhymes was accompanied, on the part of the\\nstranger, by a regular rise and fall of his right hand, which\\nterminated at the descent, by suffering the fingers to dwell a moment on\\nthe leaves of the little volume; and on the ascent, by such a flourish\\nof the member as none but the initiated may ever hope to imitate. It\\nwould seem that long practice had rendered this manual accompaniment\\nnecessary; for it did not cease until the preposition which the poet had\\nselected for the close of his verse, had been duly delivered like a word\\nof two syllables.\\n\\nSuch an innovation on the silence and retirement of the forest could not\\nfail to enlist the ears of those who journeyed at so short a distance in\\nadvance. The Indian muttered a few words in broken English to Heyward,\\nwho, in his turn, spoke to the stranger; at once interrupting, and, for\\nthe time, closing his musical efforts.\\n\\n\"Though we are not in danger, common prudence would teach us to journey\\nthrough this wilderness in as quiet a manner as possible. You will,\\nthen, pardon me, Alice, should I diminish your enjoyments, by requesting\\nthis gentleman to postpone his chant until a safer opportunity.\"\\n\\n\"You will diminish them, indeed,\" returned the arch girl, \"for never did\\nI hear a more unworthy conjunction of execution and language, than that\\nto which I have been listening; and I was far gone in a learned inquiry\\ninto the causes of such an unfitness between sound and sense, when you\\nbroke the charm of my musings by that bass of yours, Duncan!\"\\n\\n\"I know not what you call my bass,\" said Heyward, piqued at her remark,\\n\"but I know that your safety, and that of Cora, is far dearer to me than\\ncould be any orchestra of Handel\\'s music.\" He paused and turned his head\\nquickly towards a thicket, and then bent his eyes suspiciously on their\\nguide, who continued his steady pace, in undisturbed gravity. The young\\nman smiled to himself, for he believed he had mistaken some shining\\nberry of the woods for the glistening eyeballs of a prowling savage, and\\nhe rode forward, continuing the conversation which had been interrupted\\nby the passing thought.\\n\\nMajor Heyward was mistaken only in suffering his youthful and generous\\npride to suppress his active watchfulness. The cavalcade had not long\\npassed, before the branches of the bushes that formed the thicket were\\ncautiously moved asunder, and a human visage, as fiercely wild as savage\\nart and unbridled passions could make it, peered out on the retiring\\nfootsteps of the travellers. A gleam of exultation shot across the\\ndarkly painted lineaments of the inhabitant of the forest, as he traced\\nthe route of his intended victims, who rode unconsciously onward; the\\nlight and graceful forms of the females waving among the trees, in the\\ncurvatures of their path, followed at each bend by the manly figure of\\nHeyward, until, finally, the shapeless person of the singing-master was\\nconcealed behind the numberless trunks of trees, that rose, in dark\\nlines, in the intermediate space.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "    'summary_text': 'Before any characters appear, the time and geography are made clear. Though it is the last war that England and France waged for a country that neither would retain, the wilderness between the forces still has to be overcome first. Thus it is in 1757, in the New York area between the head waters of the Hudson River and Lake George to the north. Because only two years earlier General Braddock was disgracefully routed by a handful of French and Indians, the frontier is now exposed to real and imaginary savage disasters as well as to the horrors of warfare. Fear has replaced reason. Near dusk of a day in July, an Indian runner named Magua arrives at Fort Edward on the upper Hudson. He has come from Fort William Henry at the southern tip of Lake George with the news that the French General Montcalm is moving south with a very large army and that Munro, commander of Fort William Henry, is in urgent need of plentiful reinforcements from General Webb. Early the next morning, a limited detachment of fifteen hundred regulars and colonists departs as if swallowed by the forest. Shortly afterwards, Major Duncan Heyward and Alice and Cora Munro, guided by Magua on foot, take by horseback a secret route toward William Henry for the girls to join their father. Blonde Alice is doubtful about Magua, covered with war paint and showing a sullen fierceness; but dark-haired Cora is stoically common sense about him, even though Heyward mentions that their father had once had to deal rigidly with the Indian. As the small party pushes on, they are overtaken by David Gamut, a tall, ungainly psalmodist ridiculously dressed and carrying a pitch pipe while riding a mare followed by its young colt. He desires to join them, and after some banter between him and Alice, he pulls out the twenty-sixth edition of The Bay Psalm Book, sounds his pipe, and renders a song \"in full, sweet, and melodious tones.\" At a muttered comment from Magua, Heyward insists upon silence for safety. Then he glances about them and, satisfied that he has seen only shining berries, smiles to himself as they move on. But he is wrong. The branches move and a man peers exultingly after them as they disappear among the dark lines of trees.',\n",
       "    'summary_analysis': \"These two chapters introduce the reader to the historical and natural settings and are indicative of the extent to which this book, as a historical novel, relates its fictional characters to real history. Only here at the beginning and later at mid-novel will the action coincide in detail with actual events, though the historic war is always somewhere in the near distance. These chapters also present four of the main fictional characters and one secondary one, all of whom will merit our concern henceforth. Major Heyward is the gallant romantic hero, but unlike most sentimental romances where for each hero there is one heroine, here there are two, Alice and Cora, blonde and brunette. And it is immediately apparent that the old tradition of weak-blonde-strong-brunette contrast is at work, stereotyping the fair Alice and dark Cora. These three are rather predictable types which both simplify and stultify the writer's efforts with them. Magua's stealthy eyes and abrupt, furtive actions mark him as a potential villain, while the exaggerated presentation of the simple, single-minded Gamut paints him as the comic and perhaps pitiable adult innocent. At this point, both are something less than realistic and fully vitalized characters, but in comparison to the other three they seem to breathe real air. The stature of originality and verisimilitude that they do show is doubtless due to the fact that they are native characters. One may note, for instance, that Heyward's comment about Munro's once dealing rigidly with Magua not only lends suspense to the situation and points to the theme of revenge but also suggests some depth of motivation for the Indian. What we call plot -- the complications of a situation and the subsequent events and actions that further entangle things before they are finally resolved in some fashion -- starts an early ferment in terms of danger and suspense. Four likable and somewhat innocent characters strike into the unknown forest wilderness with a doubtful guide. It is a time of urgency, and movement is swift. Cooper hardly gives the reader time to question seriously why Munro's daughters would push forward their visit at this worst of times and would feel themselves safer almost alone on a dim path in savage-infested territory than in the company of fifteen hundred trained fighting men. This represents a lack in character motivation, but Cooper knows that he must get his people into jeopardy, and he at least partly succeeds in hiding this lack under suspenseful action and a sense of urgency. But in spite of the pace, Cooper also manages a good instance of dramatic irony, a fictional presentation in which the reader is allowed to see or deduce predicaments unknown or only partly known by the characters. It is thus that the first part of the pattern of action -- that of pursuit -- has begun.\",\n",

       "    'chapter': '\\n  \"Before these fields were shorn and tilled,\\n    Full to the brim our rivers flowed;\\n  The melody of waters filled\\n    The fresh and boundless wood;\\n  And torrents dashed, and rivulets played,\\n    And fountains spouted in the shade.\"\\n\\n  BRYANT.\\n\\n\\nLeaving the unsuspecting Heyward and his confiding companions to\\npenetrate still deeper into a forest that contained such treacherous\\ninmates, we must use an author\\'s privilege, and shift the scene a few\\nmiles to the westward of the place where we have last seen them.\\n\\nOn that day, two men were lingering on the banks of a small but rapid\\nstream, within an hour\\'s journey of the encampment of Webb, like those\\nwho awaited the appearance of an absent person, or the approach of some\\nexpected event. The vast canopy of woods spread itself to the margin of\\nthe river overhanging the water, and shadowing its dark current with a\\ndeeper hue. The rays of the sun were beginning to grow less fierce, and\\nthe intense heat of the day was lessened, as the cooler vapors of the\\nsprings and fountains rose above their leafy beds, and rested in the\\natmosphere. Still that breathing silence, which marks the drowsy\\nsultriness of an American landscape in July, pervaded the secluded spot,\\ninterrupted only by the low voices of the men, the occasional and lazy\\ntap of a woodpecker, the discordant cry of some gaudy jay, or a swelling\\non the ear, from the dull roar of a distant waterfall.\\n\\nThese feeble and broken sounds were, however, too familiar to the\\nforesters, to draw their attention from the more interesting matter of\\ntheir dialogue. While one of these loiterers showed the red skin and\\nwild accoutrements of a native of the woods, the other exhibited,\\nthrough the mask of his rude and nearly savage equipments, the brighter,\\nthough sunburnt and long-faded complexion of one who might claim descent\\nfrom a European parentage. The former was seated on the end of a mossy\\nlog, in a posture that permitted him to heighten the effect of his\\nearnest language, by the calm but expressive gestures of an Indian\\nengaged in debate. His body, which was nearly naked, presented a\\nterrific emblem of death, drawn in intermingled colors of white and\\nblack. His closely shaved head, on which no other hair than the well\\nknown and chivalrous scalping tuft[5] was preserved, was without\\nornament of any kind, with the exception of a solitary eagle\\'s plume,\\nthat crossed his crown, and depended over the left shoulder. A tomahawk\\nand scalping-knife, of English manufacture, were in his girdle; while a\\nshort military rifle, of that sort with which the policy of the whites\\narmed their savage allies, lay carelessly across his bare and sinewy\\nknee. The expanded chest, full formed limbs, and grave countenance of\\nthis warrior, would denote that he had reached the vigor of his days,\\nthough no symptoms of decay appeared to have yet weakened his manhood.\\n\\nThe frame of the white man, judging by such parts as were not concealed\\nby his clothes, was like that of one who had known hardships and\\nexertion from his earliest youth. His person, though muscular, was\\nrather attenuated than full; but every nerve and muscle appeared strung\\nand indurated by unremitted exposure and toil. He wore a hunting-shirt\\nof forest green, fringed with faded yellow[6], and a summer cap of skins\\nwhich had been shorn of their fur. He also bore a knife in a girdle of\\nwampum, like that which confined the scanty garments of the Indian, but\\nno tomahawk. His moccasins were ornamented after the gay fashion of the\\nnatives, while the only part of his under-dress which appeared below the\\nhunting-frock, was a pair of buckskin leggings, that laced at the sides,\\nand which were gartered above the knees with the sinews of a deer. A\\npouch and horn completed his personal accoutrements, though a rifle of\\ngreat length[7], which the theory of the more ingenious whites had\\ntaught them was the most dangerous of all fire-arms, leaned against a\\nneighboring sapling. The eye of the hunter, or scout, whichever he might\\nbe, was small, quick, keen, and restless, roving while he spoke, on\\nevery side of him, as if in quest of game, or distrusting the sudden\\napproach of some lurking enemy. Notwithstanding the symptoms of habitual\\nsuspicion, his countenance was not only without guile, but at the moment\\nat which he is introduced, it was charged with an expression of sturdy\\nhonesty.\\n\\n\"Even your traditions make the case in my favor, Chingachgook,\" he said,\\nspeaking in the tongue which was known to all the natives who formerly\\ninhabited the country between the Hudson and the Potomac, and of which\\nwe shall give a free translation for the benefit of the reader;\\nendeavoring, at the same time, to preserve some of the peculiarities,\\nboth of the individual and of the language. \"Your fathers came from the\\nsetting sun, crossed the big river,[8] fought the people of the country,\\nand took the land; and mine came from the red sky of the morning, over\\nthe salt lake, and did their work much after the fashion that had been\\nset them by yours; then let God judge the matter between us, and friends\\nspare their words!\"\\n\\n\"My fathers fought with the naked redmen!\" returned the Indian sternly,\\nin the same language. \"Is there no difference, Hawkeye, between the\\nstone-headed arrow of the warrior, and the leaden bullet with which you\\nkill?\"\\n\\n\"There is reason in an Indian, though nature has made him with a red\\nskin!\" said the white man, shaking his head like one on whom such an\\nappeal to his justice was not thrown away. For a moment he appeared to\\nbe conscious of having the worst of the argument, then, rallying again,\\nhe answered the objection of his antagonist in the best manner his\\nlimited information would allow: \"I am no scholar, and I care not who\\nknows it; but judging from what I have seen, at deer chases and squirrel\\nhunts, of the sparks below, I should think a rifle in the hands of their\\ngrandfathers was not so dangerous as a hickory bow and a good flint-head\\nmight be, if drawn with Indian judgment, and sent by an Indian eye.\"\\n\\n\"You have the story told by your fathers,\" returned the other, coldly\\nwaving his hand. \"What say your old men? do they tell the young\\nwarriors, that the pale-faces met the redmen, painted for war and armed\\nwith the stone hatchet and wooden gun?\"\\n\\n\"I am not a prejudiced man, nor one who vaunts himself on his natural\\nprivileges, though the worst enemy I have on earth, and he is an\\nIroquois, daren\\'t deny that I am genuine white,\" the scout replied,\\nsurveying, with secret satisfaction, the faded color of his bony and\\nsinewy hand; \"and I am willing to own that my people have many ways, of\\nwhich, as an honest man, I can\\'t approve. It is one of their customs to\\nwrite in books what they have done and seen, instead of telling them in\\ntheir villages, where the lie can be given to the face of a cowardly\\nboaster, and the brave soldier can call on his comrades to witness for\\nthe truth of his words. In consequence of this bad fashion, a man who is\\ntoo conscientious to misspend his days among the women, in learning the\\nnames of black marks, may never hear of the deeds of his fathers, nor\\nfeel a pride in striving to outdo them. For myself, I conclude the\\nBumppos could shoot, for I have a natural turn with a rifle, which must\\nhave been handed down from generation to generation, as, our holy\\ncommandments tell us, all good and evil gifts are bestowed; though I\\nshould be loth to answer for other people in such a matter. But every\\nstory has its two sides; so I ask you, Chingachgook, what passed,\\naccording to the traditions of the redmen, when our fathers first met?\"\\n\\nA silence of a minute succeeded, during which the Indian sat mute; then,\\nfull of the dignity of his office, he commenced his brief tale, with a\\nsolemnity that served to heighten its appearance of truth.\\n\\n\"Listen, Hawkeye, and your ear shall drink no lie. \\'Tis what my fathers\\nhave said, and what the Mohicans have done.\" He hesitated a single\\ninstant, and bending a cautious glance toward his companion, he\\ncontinued, in a manner that was divided between interrogation and\\nassertion, \"Does not this stream at our feet run towards the summer,\\nuntil its waters grow salt, and the current flows upward?\"\\n\\n\"It can\\'t be denied that your traditions tell you true in both these\\nmatters,\" said the white man; \"for I have been there, and have seen\\nthem; though, why water, which is so sweet in the shade, should become\\nbitter in the sun, is an alteration for which I have never been able to\\naccount.\"\\n\\n\"And the current!\" demanded the Indian, who expected his reply with that\\nsort of interest that a man feels in the confirmation of testimony, at\\nwhich he marvels even while he respects it; \"the fathers of Chingachgook\\nhave not lied!\"\\n\\n\"The Holy Bible is not more true, and that is the truest thing in\\nnature. They call this up-stream current the tide, which is a thing soon\\nexplained, and clear enough. Six hours the waters run in, and six hours\\nthey run out, and the reason is this: when there is higher water in the\\nsea than in the river, they run in, until the river gets to be highest,\\nand then it runs out again.\"\\n\\n\"The waters in the woods, and on the great lakes, run downward until\\nthey lie like my hand,\" said the Indian, stretching the limb\\nhorizontally before him, \"and then they run no more.\"\\n\\n\"No honest man will deny it,\" said the scout, a little nettled at the\\nimplied distrust of his explanation of the mystery of the tides; \"and I\\ngrant that it is true on the small scale, and where the land is level.\\nBut everything depends on what scale you look at things. Now, on the\\nsmall scale, the \\'arth is level; but on the large scale it is round. In\\nthis manner, pools and ponds, and even the great fresh-water lake, may\\nbe stagnant, as you and I both know they are, having seen them; but when\\nyou come to spread water over a great tract, like the sea, where the\\nearth is round, how in reason can the water be quiet? You might as well\\nexpect the river to lie still on the brink of those black rocks a mile\\nabove us, though your own ears tell you that it is tumbling over them at\\nthis very moment!\"\\n\\nIf unsatisfied by the philosophy of his companion, the Indian was far\\ntoo dignified to betray his unbelief. He listened like one who was\\nconvinced, and resumed his narrative in his former solemn manner.\\n\\n\"We came from the place where the sun is hid at night, over great plains\\nwhere the buffaloes live, until we reached the big river. There we\\nfought the Alligewi, till the ground was red with their blood. From the\\nbanks of the big river to the shores of the salt lake, there was none to\\nmeet us. The Maquas followed at a distance. We said the country should\\nbe ours from the place where the water runs up no longer on this stream,\\nto a river twenty suns\\' journey toward the summer. The land we had taken\\nlike warriors, we kept like men. We drove the Maquas into the woods with\\nthe bears. They only tasted salt at the licks; they drew no fish from\\nthe great lake; we threw them the bones.\"\\n\\n\"All this I have heard and believe,\" said the white man, observing that\\nthe Indian paused: \"but it was long before the English came into the\\ncountry.\"\\n\\n\"A pine grew then where this chestnut now stands. The first pale-faces\\nwho came among us spoke no English. They came in a large canoe, when my\\nfathers had buried the tomahawk with the redmen around them. Then,\\nHawkeye,\" he continued, betraying his deep emotion only by permitting\\nhis voice to fall to those low, guttural tones, which rendered his\\nlanguage, as spoken at times, so very musical; \"then, Hawkeye, we were\\none people, and we were happy. The salt lake gave us its fish, the wood\\nits deer, and the air its birds. We took wives who bore us children; we\\nworshipped the Great Spirit; and we kept the Maquas beyond the sound of\\nour songs of triumph!\"\\n\\n\"Know you anything of your own family at that time?\" demanded the white.\\n\"But you are a just man, for an Indian! and, as I suppose you hold their\\ngifts, your fathers must have been brave warriors, and wise men at the\\ncouncil fire.\"\\n\\n\"My tribe is the grandfather of nations, but I am an unmixed man. The\\nblood of chiefs is in my veins, where it must stay forever. The Dutch\\nlanded, and gave my people the fire-water; they drank until the heavens\\nand the earth seemed to meet, and they foolishly thought they had found\\nthe Great Spirit. Then they parted with their land. Foot by foot, they\\nwere driven back from the shores, until I, that am a chief and a\\nsagamore, have never seen the sun shine but through the trees, and have\\nnever visited the graves of, my fathers!\"\\n\\n\"Graves bring solemn feelings over the mind,\" returned the scout, a good\\ndeal touched at the calm suffering of his companion; \"and they often aid\\na man in his good intentions; though, for myself, I expect to leave my\\nown bones unburied, to bleach in the woods, or to be torn asunder by the\\nwolves. But where are to be found those of your race who came to their\\nkin in the Delaware country, so many summers since?\"\\n\\n\"Where are the blossoms of those summers!--fallen, one by one: so all of\\nmy family departed, each in his turn, to the land of spirits. I am on\\nthe hill-top, and must go down into the valley; and when Uncas follows\\nin my footsteps, there will no longer be any of the blood of the\\nsagamores, for my boy is the last of the Mohicans.\"\\n\\n\"Uncas is here!\" said another voice, in the same soft, guttural tones,\\nnear his elbow; \"who speaks to Uncas?\"\\n\\nThe white man loosened his knife in his leathern sheath, and made an\\ninvoluntary movement of the hand towards his rifle, at this sudden\\ninterruption; but the Indian sat composed, and without turning his head\\nat the unexpected sounds.\\n\\nAt the next instant, a youthful warrior passed between them, with a\\nnoiseless step, and seated himself on the bank of the rapid stream. No\\nexclamation of surprise escaped the father, nor was any question asked,\\nor reply given, for several minutes; each appearing to await the moment\\nwhen he might speak, without betraying womanish curiosity or childish\\nimpatience. The white man seemed to take counsel from their customs,\\nand, relinquishing his grasp of the rifle, he also remained silent and\\nreserved. At length Chingachgook turned his eyes slowly towards his son,\\nand demanded,--\\n\\n\"Do the Maquas dare to leave the print of their moccasins in these\\nwoods?\"\\n\\n\"I have been on their trail,\" replied the young Indian, \"and know that\\nthey number as many as the fingers of my two hands; but they lie hid,\\nlike cowards.\"\\n\\n\"The thieves are outlying for scalps and plunder!\" said the white man,\\nwhom we shall call Hawkeye, after the manner of his companions. \"That\\nbushy Frenchman, Montcalm, will send his spies into our very camp, but\\nhe will know what road we travel!\"\\n\\n\"Tis enough!\" returned the father, glancing his eye towards the setting\\nsun; \"they shall be driven like deer from their bushes. Hawkeye, let us\\neat to-night, and show the Maquas that we are men to-morrow.\"\\n\\n\"I am as ready to do the one as the other; but to fight the Iroquois\\n\\'tis necessary to find the skulkers; and to eat, \\'tis necessary to get\\nthe game--talk of the devil and he will come; there is a pair of the\\nbiggest antlers I have seen this season, moving the bushes below the\\nhill! Now, Uncas,\" he continued in a half whisper, and laughing with a\\nkind of inward sound, like one who had learnt to be watchful, \"I will\\nbet my charger three times full of powder, against a foot of wampum,\\nthat I take him atwixt the eyes, and nearer to the right than to the\\nleft.\"\\n\\n\"It cannot be!\" said the young Indian, springing to his feet with\\nyouthful eagerness; \"all but the tips of his horns are hid!\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s a boy!\" said the white man, shaking his head while he spoke, and\\naddressing the father. \"Does he think when a hunter sees a part of the\\ncreatur\\', he can\\'t tell where the rest of him should be!\"\\n\\n[Illustration: _Copyright by Charles Scribner\\'s Sons_\\n\\nUNCAS SLAYS A DEER\\n\\n_Avoiding the horns of the infuriated animal, Uncas darted to his side,\\nand passed his knife across the throat_]\\n\\nAdjusting his rifle, he was about to make an exhibition of that skill,\\non which he so much valued himself, when the warrior struck up the piece\\nwith his hand, saying--\\n\\n\"Hawkeye! will you fight the Maquas?\"\\n\\n\"These Indians know the nature of the woods, as it might be by\\ninstinct!\" returned the scout, dropping his rifle, and turning away like\\na man who was convinced of his error. \"I must leave the buck to your\\narrow, Uncas, or we may kill a deer for them thieves, the Iroquois, to\\neat.\"\\n\\nThe instant the father seconded this intimation by an expressive gesture\\nof the hand, Uncas threw himself on the ground, and approached the\\nanimal with wary movements. When within a few yards of the cover, he\\nfitted an arrow to his bow with the utmost care, while the antlers\\nmoved, as if their owner snuffed an enemy in the tainted air. In another\\nmoment the twang of the cord was heard, a white streak was seen glancing\\ninto the bushes, and the wounded buck plunged from the cover, to the\\nvery feet of his hidden enemy. Avoiding the horns of the infuriated\\nanimal, Uncas darted to his side, and passed his knife across the\\nthroat, when bounding to the edge of the river it fell, dyeing the\\nwaters with its blood.\\n\\n\"\\'Twas done with Indian skill,\" said the scout, laughing inwardly, but\\nwith vast satisfaction; \"and \\'twas a pretty sight to behold! Though an\\narrow is a near shot, and needs a knife to finish the work.\"\\n\\n\"Hugh!\" ejaculated his companion, turning quickly, like a hound who\\nscented game.\\n\\n\"By the Lord, there is a drove of them!\" exclaimed the scout, whose eyes\\nbegan to glisten with the ardor of his usual occupation; \"if they come\\nwithin range of a bullet I will drop one, though the whole Six Nations\\nshould be lurking within sound! What do you hear, Chingachgook? for to\\nmy ears the woods are dumb.\"\\n\\n\"There is but one deer, and he is dead,\" said the Indian, bending his\\nbody till his ear nearly touched the earth. \"I hear the sounds of feet!\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps the wolves have driven the buck to shelter, and are following\\non his trail.\"\\n\\n\"No. The horses of white men are coming!\" returned the other, raising\\nhimself with dignity, and resuming his seat on the log with his former\\ncomposure. \"Hawkeye, they are your brothers; speak to them.\"\\n\\n\"That will I, and in English that the king needn\\'t be ashamed to\\nanswer,\" returned the hunter, speaking in the language of which he\\nboasted; \"but I see nothing, nor do I hear the sounds of man or beast;\\n\\'tis strange that an Indian should understand white sounds better than a\\nman who, his very enemies will own, has no cross in his blood, although\\nhe may have lived with the redskins long enough to be suspected! Ha!\\nthere goes something like the cracking of a dry stick, too--now I hear\\nthe bushes move--yes, yes, there is a trampling that I mistook for the\\nfalls--and--but here they come themselves; God keep them from the\\nIroquois!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "    'summary_text': 'In another part of the forest by the river a few miles to the west, Hawkeye and Chingachgook appear to be waiting for someone as they talk with low voices. It is now afternoon. The Indian and the scout are attired according to their forest habits: Chingachgook with his semi-nude, war-painted body and scalping tuft of hair, his tomahawk, scalping knife, and short rifle; Hawkeye with his hunting shirt, skin cap, buckskin leggings, knife, pouch and horn, and long rifle. They discuss their respective forefathers, and Chingachgook relates the slow demise of his tribe of Mohicans so that only he and his son Uncas now remain. At the mention of his name, Uncas, a youthful warrior dressed much like Hawkeye, appears and says that he has been on the trail of the Maquas, another name for the Mengwe or Iroquois, their natural enemies. The antlers of a deer are seen in the distance, and Hawkeye is about to shoot the animal for food when the warrior warns him that a shot will warn the enemy. Just as Uncas kills it with an arrow, they hear the sounds of feet which Chingachgook recognizes as the horses of white men.',\n",

Through the talk of the scout and the senior Indian, the rightness of racial \"gifts\" is established. Their discussion of differences between currents and tides, between the large salt ocean and the smaller fresh lakes, reflects the novel\\'s central motif of relativity as Hawkeye concludes that \"\\'everything depends on what scale you look at things.\" Hawkeye\\'s precipitant movement to shoot the deer at first makes his awareness of the forest dangers questionable, but the need for action is natural to this kind of man after idleness, and the incident shows his pride in handling his rifle. Such an incident makes this ideal frontiersman also human. By the end of this chapter, all the principal characters are introduced, with each one\\'s general qualities established.

Doubtful, especially when he learns that the guide is a Huron who has been adopted by the Mohawks, Hawkeye makes an a priori judgment of the still-unseen guide and uses the contemptuous term Mingo: \\\\\"he who is born a Mingo will die a Mingo.\\\\\" His two Indian companions concur with his thinking. Still doubting and cautious, be baits Heyward by bantering away about Indians until Heyward reveals that he is the major of the 60th regiment of the king at William Henry. Walking to the rear of the party for a look at Magua, Hawkeye returns and says that he could guide them back to Fort Edward, which is only an hour\\'s journey away, but that it would be impossible because of the ladies and the dangers of coming night, particularly with the Mohawk as a companion. He suggests his shooting and disabling Magua from where he stands, but the major will not hear of it. Consequently, as the sun goes down, he sends the two Mohicans through the thickets on opposite sides of the path and tells the major to engage Magua in talk while he himself converses with Gamut. Magua proudly refers to himself as Le Renard Subtil , the name his Canada fathers have given him. He is cautiously quiet but allows Heyward to convince him to sit and eat. As slight sounds in the thicket make Le Renard alert, Heyward dismounts, determined to seize the treacherous guide, but the latter strikes up the major\\'s arm, gives a piercing cry, and darts away into the thicket. Immediately Chingachgook and Uncas appear and give swift pursuit just as a flash comes from Hawkeye\\'s rifle.\", \"analysis\": \"Since this chapter is mostly one of surface action, little comment is needed except to point out Hawkeye\\'s respect for the military and the fact that all Iroquois tribes are to be looked upon as treacherous enemies. The alertness and swift action of Magua, who is more of a threat when they do not know his whereabouts, mark him as a worthy opponent for the stalwart protagonists. His escape heightens the suspense of the story.\"}',\n",
       "    'chapter': '\\n  \"Well, go thy way: thou shalt not from this grove\\n  Till I torment thee for this injury.\"\\n\\n  _Midsummer Night\\'s Dream._\\n\\n\\nThe words were still in the mouth of the scout, when the leader of the\\nparty, whose approaching footsteps had caught the vigilant ear of the\\nIndian, came openly into view. A beaten path, such as those made by the\\nperiodical passage of the deer, wound through a little glen at no great\\ndistance, and struck the river at the point where the white man and his\\nred companions had posted themselves. Along this track the travellers,\\nwho had produced a surprise so unusual in the depths of the forest,\\nadvanced slowly towards the hunter, who was in front of his associates,\\nin readiness to receive them.\\n\\n\"Who comes?\" demanded the scout, throwing his rifle carelessly across\\nhis left arm, and keeping the forefinger of his right hand on the\\ntrigger, though he avoided all appearance of menace in the act, \"Who\\ncomes hither, among the beasts and dangers of the wilderness?\"\\n\\n\"Believers in religion, and friends to the law and to the king,\"\\nreturned he who rode foremost. \"Men who have journeyed since the rising\\nsun, in the shades of this forest, without nourishment, and are sadly\\ntired of their wayfaring.\"\\n\\n\"You are, then, lost,\" interrupted the hunter, \"and have found how\\nhelpless \\'tis not to know whether to take the right hand or the left?\"\\n\\n\"Even so; sucking babes are not more dependent on those who guide them\\nthan we who are of larger growth, and who may now be said to possess the\\nstature without the knowledge of men. Know you the distance to a post of\\nthe crown called William Henry?\"\\n\\n\"Hoot!\" shouted the scout, who did not spare his open laughter, though,\\ninstantly checking the dangerous sounds, he indulged his merriment at\\nless risk of being overheard by any lurking enemies. \"You are as much\\noff the scent as a hound would be, with Horican atwixt him and the deer!\\nWilliam Henry, man! if you are friends to the king, and have business\\nwith the army, your better way would be to follow the river down to\\nEdward, and lay the matter before Webb; who tarries there, instead of\\npushing into the defiles, and driving this saucy Frenchman back across\\nChamplain, into his den again.\"\\n\\nBefore the stranger could make any reply to this unexpected proposition,\\nanother horseman dashed the bushes aside, and leaped his charger into\\nthe pathway, in front of his companion.\\n\\n\"What, then, may be our distance from Fort Edward?\" demanded a new\\nspeaker; \"the place you advise us to seek we left this morning, and our\\ndestination is the head of the lake.\"\\n\\n\"Then you must have lost your eyesight afore losing your way, for the\\nroad across the portage is cut to a good two rods, and is as grand a\\npath, I calculate, as any that runs into London, or even before the\\npalace of the king himself.\"\\n\\n\"We will not dispute concerning the excellence of the passage,\" returned\\nHeyward, smiling; for, as the reader has anticipated, it was he. \"It is\\nenough, for the present, that we trusted to an Indian guide to take us\\nby a nearer, though blinder path, and that we are deceived in his\\nknowledge. In plain words, we know not where we are.\"\\n\\n\"An Indian lost in the woods!\" said the scout, shaking his head\\ndoubtingly; \"when the sun is scorching the tree-tops, and the\\nwater-courses are full; when the moss on every beech he sees, will tell\\nhim in which quarter the north star will shine at night! The woods are\\nfull of deer paths which run to the streams and licks, places well known\\nto everybody; nor have the geese done their flight to the Canada waters\\naltogether! \\'Tis strange that an Indian should be lost atwixt Horican\\nand the bend in the river. Is he a Mohawk?\"\\n\\n\"Not by birth, though adopted in that tribe; I think his birthplace was\\nfarther north, and he is one of those you call a Huron.\"\\n\\n\"Hugh!\" exclaimed the two companions of the scout, who had continued,\\nuntil this part of the dialogue, seated immovable, and apparently\\nindifferent to what passed, but who now sprang to their feet with an\\nactivity and interest that had evidently got the better of their\\nreserve, by surprise.\\n\\n\"A Huron!\" repeated the sturdy scout, once more shaking his head in open\\ndistrust; \"they are a thievish race, nor do I care by whom they are\\nadopted; you can never make anything of them but skulks and vagabonds.\\nSince you trusted yourself to the care of one of that nation, I only\\nwonder that you have not fallen in with more.\"\\n\\n\"Of that there is little danger, since William Henry is so many miles in\\nour front. You forget that I have told you our guide is now a Mohawk,\\nand that he serves with our forces as a friend.\"\\n\\n\"And I tell you that he who is born a Mingo will die a Mingo,\" returned\\nthe other, positively. \"A Mohawk! No, give me a Delaware or a Mohican\\nfor honesty; and when they will fight, which they won\\'t all do, having\\nsuffered their cunning enemies, the Maquas, to make them women--but when\\nthey will fight at all, look to a Delaware, or a Mohican, for a\\nwarrior!\"\\n\\n\"Enough of this,\" said Heyward, impatiently; \"I wish not to inquire into\\nthe character of a man that I know, and to whom you must be a stranger.\\nYou have not yet answered my question: what is our distance from the\\nmain army at Edward?\"\\n\\n\"It seems that may depend on who is your guide. One would think such a\\nhorse as that might get over a good deal of ground atwixt sun-up and\\nsun-down.\"\\n\\n\"I wish no contention of idle words with you, friend,\" said Heyward,\\ncurbing his dissatisfied manner, and speaking in a more gentle voice;\\n\"if you will tell me the distance to Fort Edward, and conduct me\\nthither, your labor shall not go without its reward.\"\\n\\n\"And in so doing, how know I that I don\\'t guide an enemy, and a spy of\\nMontcalm, to the works of the army? It is not every man who can speak\\nthe English tongue that is an honest subject.\"\\n\\n\"If you serve with the troops, of whom I judge you to be a scout, you\\nshould know of such a regiment of the king as the 60th.\"\\n\\n\"The 60th! you can tell me little of the Royal Americans that I don\\'t\\nknow, though I do wear a hunting-shirt instead of a scarlet jacket.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, among the other things, you may know the name of its\\nmajor?\"\\n\\n\"Its major!\" interrupted the hunter, elevating his body like one who was\\nproud of his trust. \"If there is a man in the country who knows Major\\nEffingham, he stands before you.\"\\n\\n\"It is a corps which has many majors; the gentleman you name is the\\nsenior, but I speak of the junior of them all; he who commands the\\ncompanies in garrison at William Henry.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, I have heard that a young gentleman of vast riches, from one\\nof the provinces far south, has got the place. He is over young, too, to\\nhold such rank, and to be put above men whose heads are beginning to\\nbleach; and yet they say he is a soldier in his knowledge, and a gallant\\ngentleman!\"\\n\\n\"Whatever he may be, or however he may be qualified for his rank, he now\\nspeaks to you, and of course can be no enemy to dread.\"\\n\\nThe scout regarded Heyward in surprise, and then lifting his cap, he\\nanswered, in a tone less confident than before, though still expressing\\ndoubt,--\\n\\n\"I have heard a party was to leave the encampment this morning, for the\\nlake shore.\"\\n\\n\"You have heard the truth; but I preferred a nearer route, trusting to\\nthe knowledge of the Indian I mentioned.\"\\n\\n\"And he deceived you, and then deserted?\"\\n\\n\"Neither, as I believe; certainly not the latter, for he is to be found\\nin the rear.\"\\n\\n\"I should like to look at the creatur\\'; if it is a true Iroquois I can\\ntell him by his knavish look, and by his paint,\" said the scout,\\nstepping past the charger of Heyward, and entering the path behind the\\nmare of the singing-master, whose foal had taken advantage of the halt\\nto exact the maternal contribution. After shoving aside the bushes, and\\nproceeding a few paces, he encountered the females, who awaited the\\nresult of the conference with anxiety, and not entirely without\\napprehension. Behind these, the runner leaned against a tree, where he\\nstood the close examination of the scout with an air unmoved, though\\nwith a look so dark and savage, that it might in itself excite fear.\\nSatisfied with his scrutiny, the hunter soon left him. As he repassed\\nthe females, he paused a moment to gaze upon their beauty, answering to\\nthe smile and nod of Alice with a look of open pleasure. Thence he went\\nto the side of the motherly animal, and spending a minute in a fruitless\\ninquiry into the character of her rider, he shook his head and returned\\nto Heyward.\\n\\n\"A Mingo is a Mingo, and God having made him so, neither the Mohawks nor\\nany other tribe can alter him,\" he said, when he had regained his former\\nposition. \"If we were alone, and you would leave that noble horse at the\\nmercy of the wolves to-night, I could show you the way to Edward,\\nmyself, within an hour, for it lies only about an hour\\'s journey hence;\\nbut with such ladies in your company \\'tis impossible!\"\\n\\n\"And why? they are fatigued, but they are quite equal to a ride of a few\\nmore miles.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis a natural impossibility!\" repeated the scout; \"I wouldn\\'t walk a\\nmile in these woods after night gets into them, in company with that\\nrunner, for the best rifle in the colonies. They are full of outlying\\nIroquois, and your mongrel Mohawk knows where to find them too well, to\\nbe my companion.\"\\n\\n\"Think you so?\" said Heyward, leaning forward in the saddle, and\\ndropping his voice nearly to a whisper; \"I confess I have not been\\nwithout my own suspicions, though I have endeavored to conceal them, and\\naffected a confidence I have not always felt, on account of my\\ncompanions. It was because I suspected him that I would follow no\\nlonger; making him, as you see, follow me.\"\\n\\n\"I knew he was one of the cheats as soon as I laid eyes on him!\"\\nreturned the scout, placing a finger on his nose, in sign of caution.\\n\"The thief is leaning against the foot of the sugar sapling, that you\\ncan see over them bushes; his right leg is in a line with the bark of\\nthe tree, and,\" tapping his rifle, \"I can take him from where I stand,\\nbetween the ankle and the knee, with a single shot, putting an end to\\nhis tramping through the woods, for at least a month to come. If I\\nshould go back to him, the cunning varmint would suspect something, and\\nbe dodging through the trees like a frightened deer.\"\\n\\n\"It will not do. He may be innocent, and I dislike the act. Though, if I\\nfelt confident of his treachery--\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis a safe thing to calculate on the knavery of an Iroquois,\" said the\\nscout, throwing his rifle forward, by a sort of instinctive movement.\\n\\n\"Hold!\" interrupted Heyward, \"it will not do--we must think of some\\nother scheme; and yet, I have much reason to believe the rascal has\\ndeceived me.\"\\n\\nThe hunter, who had already abandoned his intention of maiming the\\nrunner, mused a moment, and then made a gesture, which instantly brought\\nhis two red companions to his side. They spoke together earnestly in the\\nDelaware language, though in an undertone; and by the gestures of the\\nwhite man, which were frequently directed towards the top of the\\nsapling, it was evident he pointed out the situation of their hidden\\nenemy. His companions were not long in comprehending his wishes, and\\nlaying aside their fire-arms, they parted, taking opposite sides of the\\npath, and burying themselves in the thicket, with such cautious\\nmovements, that their steps were inaudible.\\n\\n\"Now, go you back,\" said the hunter, speaking again to Heyward, \"and\\nhold the imp in talk; these Mohicans here will take him without breaking\\nhis paint.\"\\n\\n\"Nay,\" said Heyward, proudly, \"I will seize him myself.\"\\n\\n\"Hist! what could you do, mounted, against an Indian in the bushes?\"\\n\\n\"I will dismount.\"\\n\\n\"And, think you, when he saw one of your feet out of the stirrup, he\\nwould wait for the other to be free? Whoever comes into the woods to\\ndeal with the natives, must use Indian fashions, if he would wish to\\nprosper in his undertakings. Go, then, talk openly to the miscreant, and\\nseem to believe him the truest friend you have on \\'arth.\"\\n\\nHeyward prepared to comply, though with strong disgust at the nature of\\nthe office he was compelled to execute. Each moment, however, pressed\\nupon him a conviction of the critical situation in which he had suffered\\nhis invaluable trust to be involved through his own confidence. The sun\\nhad already disappeared, and the woods, suddenly deprived of his\\nlight,[9] were assuming a dusky hue, which keenly reminded him that the\\nhour the savage usually chose for his most barbarous and remorseless\\nacts of vengeance or hostility, was speedily drawing near. Stimulated by\\napprehension, he left the scout, who immediately entered into a loud\\nconversation with the stranger that had so unceremoniously enlisted\\nhimself in the party of travellers that morning. In passing his gentler\\ncompanions Heyward uttered a few words of encouragement, and was pleased\\nto find that, though fatigued with the exercise of the day, they\\nappeared to entertain no suspicion that their present embarrassment was\\nother than the result of accident. Giving them reason to believe he was\\nmerely employed in a consultation concerning the future route, he\\nspurred his charger, and drew the reins again, when the animal had\\ncarried him within a few yards of the place where the sullen runner\\nstill stood, leaning against the tree.\\n\\n\"You may see, Magua,\" he said, endeavoring to assume an air of freedom\\nand confidence, \"that the night is closing around us, and yet we are no\\nnearer to William Henry than when we left the encampment of Webb with\\nthe rising sun. You have missed the way, nor have I been more fortunate.\\nBut, happily we have fallen in with a hunter, he whom you hear talking\\nto the singer, that is acquainted with the deer-paths and by-ways of the\\nwoods, and who promises to lead us to a place where we may rest securely\\ntill the morning.\"\\n\\nThe Indian riveted his glowing eyes on Heyward as he asked, in his\\nimperfect English, \"Is he alone?\"\\n\\n\"Alone!\" hesitatingly answered Heyward to whom deception was too new to\\nbe assumed without embarrassment. \"O! not alone, surely, Magua, for you\\nknow that we are with him.\"\\n\\n\"Then Le Renard Subtil will go,\" returned the runner, coolly raising his\\nlittle wallet from the place where it had lain at his feet; \"and the\\npale-faces will see none but their own color.\"\\n\\n\"Go! Whom call you Le Renard?\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis the name his Canada fathers have given to Magua,\" returned the\\nrunner, with an air that manifested his pride at the distinction. \"Night\\nis the same as day to Le Subtil, when Munro waits for him.\"\\n\\n\"And what account will Le Renard give the chief of William Henry\\nconcerning his daughters? Will he dare to tell the hot-blooded Scotsman\\nthat his children are left without a guide, though Magua promised to be\\none?\"\\n\\n\"Though the gray head has a loud voice, and a long arm, Le Renard will\\nnot hear him, or feel him, in the woods.\"\\n\\n\"But what will the Mohawks say? They will make him petticoats, and bid\\nhim stay in the wigwam with the women, for he is no longer to be trusted\\nwith the business of a man.\"\\n\\n\"Le Subtil knows the path to the great lakes, and he can find the bones\\nof his fathers,\" was the answer of the unmoved runner.\\n\\n\"Enough, Magua,\" said Heyward; \"are we not friends? Why should there be\\nbitter words between us? Munro has promised you a gift for your services\\nwhen performed, and I shall be your debtor for another. Rest your weary\\nlimbs, then, and open your wallet to eat. We have a few moments to\\nspare; let us not waste them in talk like wrangling women. When the\\nladies are refreshed we will proceed.\"\\n\\n\"The pale-faces make themselves dogs to their women,\" muttered the\\nIndian, in his native language, \"and when they want to eat, their\\nwarriors must lay aside the tomahawk to feed their laziness.\"\\n\\n\"What say you, Renard?\"\\n\\n\"Le Subtil says it is good.\"\\n\\nThe Indian then fastened his eyes keenly on the open countenance of\\nHeyward, but meeting his glance, he turned them quickly away, and\\nseating himself deliberately on the ground, he drew forth the remnant of\\nsome former repast, and began to eat, though not without first bending\\nhis looks slowly and cautiously around him.\\n\\n\"This is well,\" continued Heyward; \"and Le Renard will have strength and\\nsight to find the path in the morning;\" he paused, for sounds like the\\nsnapping of a dried stick, and the rustling of leaves, rose from the\\nadjacent bushes, but recollecting himself instantly, he continued,--\"we\\nmust be moving before the sun is seen, or Montcalm may lie in our path,\\nand shut us out from the fortress.\"\\n\\nThe hand of Magua dropped from his mouth to his side, and though his\\neyes were fastened on the ground, his head was turned aside, his\\nnostrils expanded, and his ears seemed even to stand more erect than\\nusual, giving to him the appearance of a statue that was made to\\nrepresent intense attention.\\n\\nHeyward, who watched his movements with a vigilant eye, carelessly\\nextricated one of his feet from the stirrup, while he passed a hand\\ntowards the bear-skin covering of his holsters. Every effort to detect\\nthe point most regarded by the runner was completely frustrated by the\\ntremulous glances of his organs, which seemed not to rest a single\\ninstant on any particular object, and which, at the same time, could be\\nhardly said to move. While he hesitated how to proceed, Le Subtil\\ncautiously raised himself to his feet, though with a motion so slow and\\nguarded, that not the slightest noise was produced by the change.\\nHeyward felt it had now become incumbent on him to act. Throwing his leg\\nover the saddle, he dismounted, with a determination to advance and\\nseize his treacherous companion, trusting the result to his own manhood.\\nIn order, however, to prevent unnecessary alarm, he still preserved an\\nair of calmness and friendship.\\n\\n\"Le Renard Subtil does not eat,\" he said, using the appellation he had\\nfound most flattering to the vanity of the Indian. \"His corn is not well\\nparched, and it seems dry. Let me examine; perhaps something may be\\nfound among my own provisions that will help his appetite.\"\\n\\nMagua held out the wallet to the proffer of the other. He even suffered\\ntheir hands to meet, without betraying the least emotion, or varying his\\nriveted attitude of attention. But when he felt the fingers of Heyward\\nmoving gently along his own naked arm, he struck up the limb of the\\nyoung man, and uttering a piercing cry as he darted beneath it, plunged,\\nat a single bound, into the opposite thicket. At the next instant the\\nform of Chingachgook appeared from the bushes, looking like a spectre in\\nits paint, and glided across the path in swift pursuit. Next followed\\nthe shout of Uncas, when the woods were lighted by a sudden flash, that\\nwas accompanied by the sharp report of the hunter\\'s rifle.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "    'summary_text': 'When the mounted party from Fort Howard approaches the three men of the woods, Hawkeye addresses first Gamut and then Heyward only to learn that they are lost because their Indian guide has taken them west instead of north toward Fort William Henry. Doubtful, especially when he learns that the guide is a Huron who has been adopted by the Mohawks, Hawkeye makes an a priori judgment of the still-unseen guide and uses the contemptuous term Mingo: \"he who is born a Mingo will die a Mingo.\" His two Indian companions concur with his thinking. Still doubting and cautious, be baits Heyward by bantering away about Indians until Heyward reveals that he is the major of the 60th regiment of the king at William Henry. Walking to the rear of the party for a look at Magua, Hawkeye returns and says that he could guide them back to Fort Edward, which is only an hour\\'s journey away, but that it would be impossible because of the ladies and the dangers of coming night, particularly with the Mohawk as a companion. He suggests his shooting and disabling Magua from where he stands, but the major will not hear of it. Consequently, as the sun goes down, he sends the two Mohicans through the thickets on opposite sides of the path and tells the major to engage Magua in talk while he himself converses with Gamut. Magua proudly refers to himself as Le Renard Subtil , the name his Canada fathers have given him. He is cautiously quiet but allows Heyward to convince him to sit and eat. As slight sounds in the thicket make Le Renard alert, Heyward dismounts, determined to seize the treacherous guide, but the latter strikes up the major\\'s arm, gives a piercing cry, and darts away into the thicket. Immediately Chingachgook and Uncas appear and give swift pursuit just as a flash comes from Hawkeye\\'s rifle.',\n",
       "    'summary_analysis': \"Since this chapter is mostly one of surface action, little comment is needed except to point out Hawkeye's respect for the military and the fact that all Iroquois tribes are to be looked upon as treacherous enemies. The alertness and swift action of Magua, who is more of a threat when they do not know his whereabouts, mark him as a worthy opponent for the stalwart protagonists. His escape heightens the suspense of the story.\",\n",

Heyward wants to continue the chase, but the scout fears an ambush, particularly since he has fired his rifle, an action for which he upbraids himself. With night almost upon them, the three woodsmen confer and, at the urging of Uncas, decide to take the group to their \\\\\"harboring place\\\\\" after Heyward promises to keep the place a secret. The horses are a problem, but rather than give them their bridles, the men agree to mislead the foe into thinking that the group is on horseback. When the colt makes a noise in the bush, the scout determines that of necessity it must die so that it cannot betray them. Uncas shoots it with an arrow and Chingachgook quickly and mercifully slits its throat and dashes it into the river to float away. While the Indians lead the horses into the river, Hawkeye and Heyward place the females in a bark canoe and, trailed by the dejected Gamut, wade in to bear it upstream toward the waterfall, passing the dark overhang of the bank where the horses are now hidden. At the falls, the scout seats all the whites in the canoe and poles it into the center of the turbulent stream, where it is whirled about until he brings it to rest beside a flat rock. \\\\\"You are at the foot of Glenn\\'s,\\\\\" he says and takes the canoe to fetch the Mohicans and the venison. When they are all together, he worriedly tells that the horses had cowered as if they scented wolves that would hover near Indian kills. He is interrupted by a sad song from Gamut, whom he tries to console for the death of the colt. Then he and the two Mohicans disappear in succession, \\\\\"seeming to vanish against the dark face of a perpendicular rock.\\\\\"\", \"analysis\": \"Here the reader encounters the first bloodshed born of war.

Now that the two parties have become one by virtue of survival necessities, Hawkeye shows his skill as a woodsman who also knows his enemies\\' ways. He stands forth as a decisive character. Gamut too grows in characterization. While the two girls give simple female reactions to the killing of the colt, Gamut grieves in such a way that he commands the solace and respect of Hawkeye, who says that \\\\\"it\\'s a good sign to see a man account upon his dumb friends.\\\\\" In being thus cruelly initiated into the expediencies of savage warfare, the singing master temporarily loses his comic character to become the sad civilian, the inexperienced outsider on whom the magnitude of these actions can fall with full personal force.\"}',\n",

Then recollecting the importance of securing the fugitive, he\\ndashed aside the surrounding bushes, and pressed eagerly forward to lend\\nhis aid in the chase. Before he had, however, proceeded a hundred yards,\\nhe met the three foresters already returning from their unsuccessful\\npursuit.\\n\\n\"Why so soon disheartened!\" he exclaimed; \"the scoundrel must be\\nconcealed behind some of these trees, and may yet be secured. We are not\\nsafe while he goes at large.\"\\n\\n\"Would you set a cloud to chase the wind?\" returned the disappointed\\nscout; \"I heard the imp, brushing over the dry leaves, like a black\\nsnake, and blinking a glimpse of him, just over ag\\'in yon big pine, I\\npulled as it might be on the scent; but \\'twouldn\\'t do! and yet for a\\nreasoning aim, if anybody but myself had touched the trigger, I should\\ncall it a quick sight; and I may be accounted to have experience in\\nthese matters, and one who ought to know. Look at this sumach; its\\nleaves are red, though everybody knows the fruit is in the yellow\\nblossom, in the month of July!\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis the blood of Le Subtil! he is hurt, and may yet fall!\"\\n\\n\"No, no,\" returned the scout, in decided disapprobation of this opinion,\\n\"I rubbed the bark off a limb, perhaps, but the creature leaped the\\nlonger for it. A rifle-bullet acts on a running animal, when it barks\\nhim, much the same as one of your spurs on a horse; that is, it quickens\\nmotion, and puts life into the flesh, instead of taking it away. But\\nwhen it cuts the ragged hole, after a bound or two, there is, commonly,\\na stagnation of further leaping, be it Indian or be it deer!\"\\n\\n\"We are four able bodies, to one wounded man!\"\\n\\n\"Is life grievous to you?\" interrupted the scout. \"Yonder red devils\\nwould draw you within swing of the tomahawks of his comrades, before you\\nwere heated in the chase. It was an unthoughtful act in a man who has so\\noften slept with the war-whoop ringing in the air, to let off his piece\\nwithin sound of an ambushment! But then it was a natural temptation!\\n\\'twas very natural! Come, friends, let us move our station, and in such\\na fashion, too, as will throw the cunning of a Mingo on a wrong scent,\\nor our scalps will be drying in the wind in front of Montcalm\\'s marquee,\\nag\\'in this hour to-morrow.\"\\n\\nThis appalling declaration, which the scout uttered with the cool\\nassurance of a man who fully comprehended, while he did not fear to face\\nthe danger, served to remind Heyward of the importance of the charge\\nwith which he himself had been intrusted. Glancing his eyes around, with\\na vain effort to pierce the gloom that was thickening beneath the leafy\\narches of the forest, he felt as if, cut off from human aid, his\\nunresisting companions would soon lie at the entire mercy of those\\nbarbarous enemies, who, like beasts of prey, only waited till the\\ngathering darkness might render their blows more fatally certain. His\\nawakened imagination, deluded by the deceptive light, converted each\\nwaving bush, or the fragment of some fallen tree, into human forms, and\\ntwenty times he fancied he could distinguish the horrid visages of his\\nlurking foes, peering from their hiding-places, in never-ceasing\\nwatchfulness of the movements of his party. Looking upward, he found\\nthat the thin fleecy clouds, which evening had painted on the blue sky,\\nwere already losing their faintest tints of rose-color, while the\\nimbedded stream, which glided past the spot where he stood, was to be\\ntraced only by the dark boundary of its wooded banks.\\n\\n\"What is to be done?\" he said, feeling the utter helplessness of doubt\\nin such a pressing strait; \"desert me not, for God\\'s sake! remain to\\ndefend those I escort, and freely name your own reward!\"\\n\\nHis companions, who conversed apart in the language of their tribe,\\nheeded not this sudden and earnest appeal. Though their dialogue was\\nmaintained in low and cautious sounds, but little above a whisper,\\nHeyward, who now approached, could easily distinguish the earnest tones\\nof the younger warrior from the more deliberate speeches of his seniors.\\nIt was evident that they debated on the propriety of some measure that\\nnearly concerned the welfare of the travellers. Yielding to his\\npowerful interest in the subject, and impatient of a delay that seemed\\nfraught with so much additional danger, Heyward drew still nigher to the\\ndusky group, with an intention of making his offers of compensation more\\ndefinite, when the white man, motioning, with his hand, as if he\\nconceded the disputed point, turned away, saying in a sort of soliloquy,\\nand in the English tongue,--\\n\\n\"Uncas is right! it would not be the act of men to leave such harmless\\nthings to their fate, even though it breaks up the harboring place\\nforever. If you would save these tender blossoms from the fangs of the\\nworst of serpents, gentleman, you have neither time to lose nor\\nresolution to throw away!\"\\n\\n\"How can such a wish be doubted! have I not already offered--\"\\n\\n\"Offer your prayers to Him who can give us wisdom to circumvent the\\ncunning of the devils who fill these woods,\" calmly interrupted the\\nscout, \"but spare your offers of money, which neither you may live to\\nrealize, nor I to profit by. These Mohicans and I will do what man\\'s\\nthoughts can invent, to keep such flowers, which, though so sweet, were\\nnever made for the wilderness, from harm, and that without hope of any\\nother recompense but such as God always gives to upright dealings.\\nFirst, you must promise two things, both in your own name and for your\\nfriends, or without serving you, we shall only injure ourselves!\"\\n\\n\"Name them.\"\\n\\n\"The one is, to be still as these sleeping woods, let what will happen;\\nand the other is, to keep the place where we shall take you, forever a\\nsecret from all mortal men.\"\\n\\n\"I will do my utmost to see both these conditions fulfilled.\"\\n\\n\"Then follow, for we are losing moments that are as precious as the\\nheart\\'s blood to a stricken deer!\"\\n\\nHeyward could distinguish the impatient gesture of the scout, through\\nthe increasing shadows of the evening, and he moved in his footsteps,\\nswiftly, towards the place where he had left the remainder of his party.\\nWhen they rejoined the expecting and anxious females, he briefly\\nacquainted them with the conditions of their new guide, and with the\\nnecessity that existed for their hushing every apprehension, in instant\\nand serious exertions. Although his alarming communication was not\\nreceived without much secret terror by the listeners, his earnest and\\nimpressive manner, aided perhaps by the nature of the danger, succeeded\\nin bracing their nerves to undergo some unlooked-for and unusual trial.\\nSilently, and without a moment\\'s delay, they permitted him to assist\\nthem from their saddles, when they descended quickly to the water\\'s\\nedge, where the scout had collected the rest of the party, more by the\\nagency of expressive gestures than by any use of words.\\n\\n\"What to do with these dumb creatures!\" muttered the white man, on whom\\nthe sole control of their future movements appeared to devolve; \"it\\nwould be time lost to cut their throats, and cast them into the river;\\nand to leave them here, would be to tell the Mingos that they have not\\nfar to seek to find their owners!\"\\n\\n\"Then give them their bridles, and let them range the woods,\" Heyward\\nventured to suggest.\\n\\n\"No; it would be better to mislead the imps, and make them believe they\\nmust equal a horse\\'s speed to run down their chase. Ay, ay, that will\\nblind their fire-balls of eyes! Chingach--Hist? what stirs the bush?\"\\n\\n\"The colt.\"\\n\\n\"That colt, at least, must die,\" muttered the scout, grasping the mane\\nof the nimble beast, which easily eluded his hand; \"Uncas, your arrows!\"\\n\\n\"Hold!\" exclaimed the proprietor of the condemned animal, aloud, without\\nregard to the whispering tones used by the others; \"spare the foal of\\nMiriam! it is the comely offspring of a faithful dam, and would\\nwillingly injure naught.\"\\n\\n\"When men struggle for the single life God has given them,\" said the\\nscout sternly, \"even their own kind seem no more than the beasts of the\\nwood. If you speak again, I shall leave you to the mercy of the Maquas!\\nDraw to your arrow\\'s head, Uncas; we have no time for second blows.\"\\n\\nThe low, muttering sounds of his threatening voice were still audible,\\nwhen the wounded foal, first rearing on its hinder legs, plunged forward\\nto its knees. It was met by Chingachgook, whose knife passed across its\\nthroat quicker than thought, and then precipitating the motions of the\\nstruggling victim, he dashed it into the river, down whose stream it\\nglided away, gasping audibly for breath with its ebbing life. This deed\\nof apparent cruelty, but of real necessity, fell upon the spirits of the\\ntravellers like a terrific warning of the peril in which they stood,\\nheightened as it was by the calm though steady resolution of the actors\\nin the scene. The sisters shuddered and clung closer to each other,\\nwhile Heyward instinctively laid his hand on one of the pistols he had\\njust drawn from their holsters, as he placed himself between his charge\\nand those dense shadows that seemed to draw an impenetrable veil before\\nthe bosom of the forest.\\n\\nThe Indians, however, hesitated not a moment, but taking the bridles,\\nthey led the frightened and reluctant horses into the bed of the river.\\n\\nAt a short distance from the shore they turned, and were soon concealed\\nby the projection of the bank, under the brow of which they moved, in a\\ndirection opposite to the course of the waters. In the meantime, the\\nscout drew a canoe of bark from its place of concealment beneath some\\nlow bushes, whose branches were waving with the eddies of the current,\\ninto which he silently motioned for the females to enter. They complied\\nwithout hesitation, though many a fearful and anxious glance was thrown\\nbehind them towards the thickening gloom which now lay like a dark\\nbarrier along the margin of the stream.\\n\\nSo soon as Cora and Alice were seated, the scout, without regarding the\\nelement, directed Heyward to support one side of the frail vessel, and\\nposting himself at the other, they bore it up against the stream,\\nfollowed by the dejected owner of the dead foal. In this manner they\\nproceeded, for many rods, in a silence that was only interrupted by the\\nrippling of the water, as its eddies played around them, or the low dash\\nmade by their own cautious footsteps. Heyward yielded the guidance of\\nthe canoe implicitly to the scout, who approached or receded from the\\nshore, to avoid the fragments of rocks, or deeper parts of the river,\\nwith a readiness that showed his knowledge of the route they held.\\nOccasionally he would stop; and in the midst of a breathing stillness,\\nthat the dull but increasing roar of the waterfall only served to render\\nmore impressive, he would listen with painful intenseness, to catch any\\nsounds that might arise from the slumbering forest. When assured that\\nall was still, and unable to detect, even by the aid of his practised\\nsenses, any sign of his approaching foes, he would deliberately resume\\nhis slow and unguarded progress. At length they reached a point in the\\nriver, where the roving eye of Heyward became riveted on a cluster of\\nblack objects, collected at a spot where the high bank threw a deeper\\nshadow than usual on the dark waters. Hesitating to advance, he pointed\\nout the place to the attention of his companion.\\n\\n\"Ay,\" returned the composed scout, \"the Indians have hid the beasts\\nwith the judgment of natives! Water leaves no trail, and an owl\\'s eyes\\nwould be blinded by the darkness of such a hole.\"\\n\\nThe whole party was soon reunited, and another consultation was held\\nbetween the scout and his new comrades, during which, they whose fates\\ndepended on the faith and ingenuity of these unknown foresters, had a\\nlittle leisure to observe their situation more minutely.\\n\\nThe river was confined between high and cragged rocks, one of which\\nimpended above the spot where the canoe rested. As these, again, were\\nsurmounted by tall trees, which appeared to totter on the brows of the\\nprecipice, it gave the stream the appearance of running through a deep\\nand narrow dell. All beneath the fantastic limbs and ragged tree-tops,\\nwhich were, here and there, dimly painted against the starry zenith, lay\\nalike in shadowed obscurity. Behind them, the curvature of the banks\\nsoon bounded the view, by the same dark and wooded outline; but in\\nfront, and apparently at no great distance, the water seemed piled\\nagainst the heavens, whence it tumbled into caverns, out of which issued\\nthose sullen sounds that had loaded the evening atmosphere. It seemed,\\nin truth, to be a spot devoted to seclusion, and the sisters imbibed a\\nsoothing impression of security, as they gazed upon its romantic, though\\nnot unappalling beauties. A general movement among their conductors,\\nhowever, soon recalled them from a contemplation of the wild charms that\\nnight had assisted to lend the place, to a painful sense of their real\\nperil.\\n\\nThe horses had been secured to some scattered shrubs that grew in the\\nfissures of the rocks, where, standing in the water, they were left to\\npass the night. The scout directed Heyward and his disconsolate\\nfellow-travellers to seat themselves in the forward end of the canoe,\\nand took possession of the other himself, as erect and steady as if he\\nfloated in a vessel of much firmer materials. The Indians warily\\nretraced their steps towards the place they had left, when the scout,\\nplacing his pole against a rock, by a powerful shove, sent his frail\\nbark directly into the centre of the turbulent stream. For many minutes\\nthe struggle between the light bubble in which they floated, and the\\nswift current, was severe and doubtful. Forbidden to stir even a hand,\\nand almost afraid to breathe, lest they should expose the frail fabric\\nto the fury of the stream, the passengers watched the glancing waters in\\nfeverish suspense. Twenty times they thought the whirling eddies were\\nsweeping them to destruction, when the master-hand of their pilot would\\nbring the bows of the canoe to stem the rapid. A long, a vigorous, and,\\nas it appeared to the females, a desperate effort, closed the struggle.\\nJust as Alice veiled her eyes in horror, under the impression that they\\nwere about to be swept within the vortex at the foot of the cataract,\\nthe canoe floated, stationary, at the side of a flat rock, that lay on a\\nlevel with the water.\\n\\n\"Where are we? and what is next to be done?\" demanded Heyward,\\nperceiving that the exertions of the scout had ceased.\\n\\n\"You are at the foot of Glenn\\'s,\" returned the other, speaking aloud,\\nwithout fear of consequences, within the roar of the cataract; \"and the\\nnext thing is to make a steady landing, lest the canoe upset, and you\\nshould go down again the hard road we have travelled, faster than you\\ncame up; \\'tis a hard rift to stem, when the river is a little swelled;\\nand five is an unnatural number to keep dry, in the hurry-skurry, with a\\nlittle birchen bark and gum. There, go you all on the rock, and I will\\nbring up the Mohicans with the venison. A man had better sleep without\\nhis scalp, than famish in the midst of plenty.\"\\n\\nHis passengers gladly complied with these directions. As the last foot\\ntouched the rock, the canoe whirled from its station, when the tall form\\nof the scout was seen, for an instant, gliding above the waters, before\\nit disappeared in the impenetrable darkness that rested on the bed of\\nthe river. Left by their guide, the travellers remained a few minutes in\\nhelpless ignorance, afraid even to move along the broken rocks, lest a\\nfalse step should precipitate them down some one of the many deep and\\nroaring caverns, into which the water seemed to tumble, on every side of\\nthem. Their suspense, however, was soon relieved; for aided by the skill\\nof the natives, the canoe shot back into the eddy, and floated again at\\nthe side of the low rock before they thought the scout had even time to\\nrejoin his companions.\\n\\n\"We are now fortified, garrisoned, and provisioned,\" cried Heyward,\\ncheerfully, \"and may set Montcalm and his allies at defiance. How, now,\\nmy vigilant sentinel, can you see anything of those you call the\\nIroquois, on the mainland?\"\\n\\n\"I call them Iroquois, because to me every native, who speaks a foreign\\ntongue, is accounted an enemy, though he may pretend to serve the king!\\nIf Webb wants faith and honesty in an Indian, let him bring out the\\ntribes of the Delawares, and send these greedy and lying Mohawks and\\nOneidas, with their six nations of varlets, where in nature they belong,\\namong the French!\"\\n\\n\"We should then exchange a warlike for a useless friend! I have heard\\nthat the Delawares have laid aside the hatchet, and are content to be\\ncalled women!\"\\n\\n\"Ay, shame on the Hollanders[10] and Iroquois, who circumvented them by\\ntheir deviltries, into such a treaty! But I have known them for twenty\\nyears, and I call him liar, that says cowardly blood runs in the veins\\nof a Delaware. You have driven their tribes from the sea-shore, and\\nwould now believe what their enemies say, that you may sleep at night\\nupon an easy pillow. No, no; to me, every Indian who speaks a foreign\\ntongue is an Iroquois, whether the castle[11] of his tribe be in Canada,\\nor be in New York.\"\\n\\nHeyward, perceiving that the stubborn adherence of the scout to the\\ncause of his friends the Delawares or Mohicans, for they were branches\\nof the same numerous people, was likely to prolong a useless discussion,\\nchanged the subject.\\n\\n\"Treaty or no treaty, I know full well, that your two companions are\\nbrave and cautious warriors! have they heard or seen anything of our\\nenemies?\"\\n\\n\"An Indian is a mortal to be felt afore he is seen,\" returned the scout,\\nascending the rock, and throwing the deer carelessly down. \"I trust to\\nother signs than such as come in at the eye, when I am outlying on the\\ntrail of the Mingos.\"\\n\\n\"Do your ears tell you that they have traced our retreat?\"\\n\\n\"I should be sorry to think they had, though this is a spot that stout\\ncourage might hold for a smart skrimmage. I will not deny, however, but\\nthe horses cowered when I passed them, as though they scented the\\nwolves; and a wolf is a beast that is apt to hover about an Indian\\nambushment, craving the offals of the deer the savages kill.\"\\n\\n\"You forget the buck at your feet! or, may we not owe their visit to the\\ndead colt? Ha! what noise is that?\"\\n\\n\"Poor Miriam!\" murmured the stranger; \"thy foal was foreordained to\\nbecome a prey to ravenous beasts!\" Then, suddenly lifting up his voice,\\namid the eternal din of the waters, he sang aloud,--\\n\\n  \"First born of Egypt, smite did He,\\n  Of mankind, and of beast also;\\n  O, Egypt! wonders sent \\'midst thee,\\n  On Pharaoh and his servants too!\"\\n\\n\"The death of the colt sits heavy on the heart of its owner,\" said the\\nscout; \"but it\\'s a good sign to see a man account upon his dumb friends.\\nHe has the religion of the matter, in believing what is to happen will\\nhappen; and with such a consolation, it won\\'t be long afore he submits\\nto the rationality of killing a four-footed beast, to save the lives of\\nhuman men. It may be as you say,\" he continued, reverting to the purport\\nof Heyward\\'s last remark; \"and the greater the reason why we should cut\\nour steaks, and let the carcase drive down the stream, or we shall have\\nthe pack howling along the cliffs, begrudging every mouthful we swallow.\\nBesides, though the Delaware tongue is the same as a book to the\\nIroquois, the cunning varlets are quick enough at understanding the\\nreason of a wolf\\'s howl.\"\\n\\nThe scout, whilst making his remarks, was busied in collecting certain\\nnecessary implements; as he concluded, he moved silently by the group of\\ntravellers, accompanied by the Mohicans, who seemed to comprehend his\\nintentions with instinctive readiness, when the whole three disappeared\\nin succession, seeming to vanish against the dark face of a\\nperpendicular rock, that rose to the height of a few yards within as\\nmany feet of the water\\'s edge.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Heyward wants to continue the chase, but the scout fears an ambush, particularly since he has fired his rifle, an action for which he upbraids himself. With night almost upon them, the three woodsmen confer and, at the urging of Uncas, decide to take the group to their \"harboring place\" after Heyward promises to keep the place a secret. The horses are a problem, but rather than give them their bridles, the men agree to mislead the foe into thinking that the group is on horseback. When the colt makes a noise in the bush, the scout determines that of necessity it must die so that it cannot betray them. Uncas shoots it with an arrow and Chingachgook quickly and mercifully slits its throat and dashes it into the river to float away. While the Indians lead the horses into the river, Hawkeye and Heyward place the females in a bark canoe and, trailed by the dejected Gamut, wade in to bear it upstream toward the waterfall, passing the dark overhang of the bank where the horses are now hidden. At the falls, the scout seats all the whites in the canoe and poles it into the center of the turbulent stream, where it is whirled about until he brings it to rest beside a flat rock. \"You are at the foot of Glenn\\'s,\" he says and takes the canoe to fetch the Mohicans and the venison. When they are all together, he worriedly tells that the horses had cowered as if they scented wolves that would hover near Indian kills.

The wounding of Magua and the killing of the innocent colt stand in contrast to the preceding shooting of the deer for food. Now that the two parties have become one by virtue of survival necessities, Hawkeye shows his skill as a woodsman who also knows his enemies\\' ways. He stands forth as a decisive character.

Hawkeye is holding a blazing knot of pine which silhouettes Uncas, the first clear sight of whose carriage and almost Grecian features relieves the lingering doubts of those from Fort Edward. When the latter also enter the cavern, they learn that at the other entrance is a narrow, open chasm running at right angles and that just beyond it is another cave. They are essentially on an island of rock with the falls and turbulent water on both sides. As they take their meal of venison, Uncas makes an innovation on his Indian customs by attending the females, betraying a bit more interest in Cora than in Alice. In spite of his continuous vigilance, Hawkeye draws out a keg and invites Gamut to \\\\\"try a little spruce.\\\\\" After they discuss Gamut\\'s name and profession, the psalmodist and the girls render a sacred number that is safely muffled by the noise of the falls. The memory of his boyhood in the settlements brings tears to the scout\\'s eyes just as the song is interrupted by a sudden, unearthly cry. In the ensuing stillness, Uncas cautiously steps outside but can see nothing to identify the unknown sound. Heyward takes the girls into the inner cave for sleep and inspects the far entrance to find directly beneath his feet an impenetrable barrier of roiling water. Though yet stoical, Cora seems for the first time to feel it rash to be trying to visit their father during this crisis. Heyward is reassuring the girls about Munro\\'s feelings for them when the horrid cry fills the air again. Within a moment, the blanket-entrance is raised and the scout stands there, his face reflecting everyone\\'s fearful sense of mystery and his own growing dismay.\", \"analysis\": \"This chapter shows Cooper in his most inventive, dramatic, and descriptive form. His sympathy and admiration for the good Indians ring through his own delineations and the appreciative words of Heyward, Alice, and Cora.

       "    'chapter': '\\n  \"Those strains that once did sweet in Zion glide;\\n  He wales a portion with judicious care;\\n  And \\'Let us worship God,\\' he says, with solemn air.\"\\n\\n  BURNS.\\n\\n\\nHeyward, and his female companions, witnessed this mysterious movement\\nwith secret uneasiness; for, though the conduct of the white man had\\nhitherto been above reproach, his rude equipments, blunt address, and\\nstrong antipathies, together with the character of his silent\\nassociates, were all causes for exciting distrust in minds that had been\\nso recently alarmed by Indian treachery.\\n\\nThe stranger alone disregarded the passing incidents. He seated himself\\non a projection of the rocks, whence he gave no other signs of\\nconsciousness than by the struggles of his spirit, as manifested in\\nfrequent and heavy sighs. Smothered voices were next heard, as though\\nmen called to each other in the bowels of the earth, when a sudden light\\nflashed upon those without, and laid bare the much-prized secret of the\\nplace.\\n\\nAt the farther extremity of a narrow, deep cavern in the rock, whose\\nlength appeared much extended by the perspective and the nature of the\\nlight by which it was seen, was seated the scout, holding a blazing knot\\nof pine. The strong glare of the fire fell full upon his sturdy,\\nweather-beaten countenance and forest attire, lending an air of romantic\\nwildness to the aspect of an individual, who, seen by the sober light of\\nday, would have exhibited the peculiarities of a man remarkable for the\\nstrangeness of his dress, the iron-like inflexibility of his frame, and\\nthe singular compound of quick, vigilant sagacity, and of exquisite\\nsimplicity, that by turns usurped the possession of his muscular\\nfeatures. At a little distance in advance stood Uncas, his whole person\\nthrown powerfully into view. The travellers anxiously regarded the\\nupright, flexible figure of the young Mohican, graceful and unrestrained\\nin the attitudes and movements of nature. Though his person was more\\nthan usually screened by a green and fringed hunting-shirt, like that of\\nthe white man, there was no concealment to his dark, glancing, fearless\\neye, alike terrible and calm; the bold outline of his high, haughty\\nfeatures, pure in their native red; or to the dignified elevation of his\\nreceding forehead, together with all the finest proportions of a noble\\nhead, bared to the generous scalping tuft. It was the first opportunity\\npossessed by Duncan and his companions, to view the marked lineaments of\\neither of their Indian attendants, and each individual of the party felt\\nrelieved from a burden of doubt, as the proud and determined, though\\nwild expression of the features of the young warrior forced itself on\\ntheir notice. They felt it might be a being partially benighted in the\\nvale of ignorance, but it could not be one who would willingly devote\\nhis rich natural gifts to the purposes of wanton treachery. The\\ningenuous Alice gazed at his free air and proud carriage, as she would\\nhave looked upon some precious relic of the Grecian chisel, to which\\nlife had been imparted by the intervention of a miracle; while Heyward,\\nthough accustomed to see the perfection of form which abounds among the\\nuncorrupted natives, openly expressed his admiration at such an\\nunblemished specimen of the noblest proportions of man.\\n\\n\"I could sleep in peace,\" whispered Alice, in reply, \"with such a\\nfearless and generous looking youth for my sentinel. Surely, Duncan,\\nthose cruel murders, those terrific scenes of torture, of which we read\\nand hear so much, are never acted in the presence of such as he!\"\\n\\n\"This, certainly, is a rare and brilliant instance of those natural\\nqualities, in which these peculiar people are said to excel,\" he\\nanswered. \"I agree with you, Alice, in thinking that such a front and\\neye were formed rather to intimidate than to deceive; but let us not\\npractise a deception upon ourselves, by expecting any other exhibition\\nof what we esteem virtue than according to the fashion of a savage. As\\nbright examples of great qualities are but too uncommon among\\nChristians, so are they singular and solitary with the Indians; though,\\nfor the honor of our common nature, neither are incapable of producing\\nthem. Let us then hope that this Mohican may not disappoint our wishes,\\nbut prove, what his looks assert him to be, a brave and constant\\nfriend.\"\\n\\n\"Now Major Heyward speaks as Major Heyward should,\" said Cora; \"who,\\nthat looks at this creature of nature, remembers the shade of his skin!\"\\n\\nA short, and apparently an embarrassed silence succeeded this remark,\\nwhich was interrupted by the scout calling to them, aloud, to enter.\\n\\n\"This fire begins to show too bright a flame,\" he continued, as they\\ncomplied, \"and might light the Mingos to our undoing. Uncas, drop the\\nblanket, and show the knaves its dark side. This is not such a supper as\\na major of the Royal Americans has a right to expect, but I\\'ve known\\nstout detachments of the corps glad to eat their venison raw, and\\nwithout a relish too.[12] Here, you see, we have plenty of salt, and can\\nmake a quick broil. There\\'s fresh sassafras boughs for the ladies to sit\\non, which may not be as proud as their my-hog-guinea chairs, but which\\nsends up a sweeter flavor than the skin of any hog can do, be it of\\nGuinea, or be it of any other land. Come, friend, don\\'t be mournful for\\nthe colt; \\'twas an innocent thing, and had not seen much hardship. Its\\ndeath will save the creature many a sore back and weary foot!\"\\n\\nUncas did as the other had directed, and when the voice of Hawkeye\\nceased, the roar of the cataract sounded like the rumbling of distant\\nthunder.\\n\\n\"Are we quite safe in this cavern?\" demanded Heyward. \"Is there no\\ndanger of surprise? A single armed man, at its entrance, would hold us\\nat his mercy.\"\\n\\nA spectral-looking figure stalked from out the darkness behind the\\nscout, and seizing a blazing brand, held it towards the farther\\nextremity of their place of retreat. Alice uttered a faint shriek, and\\neven Cora rose to her feet, as this appalling object moved into the\\nlight; but a single word from Heyward calmed them, with the assurance it\\nwas only their attendant, Chingachgook, who, lifting another blanket,\\ndiscovered that the cavern had two outlets. Then, holding the brand, he\\ncrossed a deep, narrow chasm in the rocks, which ran at right angles\\nwith the passage they were in, but which, unlike that, was open to the\\nheavens, and entered another cave, answering to the description of the\\nfirst, in every essential particular.\\n\\n\"Such old foxes as Chingachgook and myself are not often caught in a\\nburrow with one hole,\" said Hawkeye, laughing; \"you can easily see the\\ncunning of the place--the rock is black limestone, which everybody knows\\nis soft; it makes no uncomfortable pillow, where brush and pine wood is\\nscarce; well, the fall was once a few yards below us, and I dare to say\\nwas, in its time, as regular and as handsome a sheet of water as any\\nalong the Hudson. But old age is a great injury to good looks, as these\\nsweet young ladies have yet to l\\'arn! The place is sadly changed! These\\nrocks are full of cracks, and in some places they are softer than at\\nothersome, and the water has worked out deep hollows for itself, until\\nit has fallen back, ay, some hundred feet, breaking here and wearing\\nthere, until the falls have neither shape nor consistency.\"\\n\\n\"In what part of them are we?\" asked Heyward.\\n\\n\"Why, we are nigh the spot that Providence first placed them at, but\\nwhere, it seems, they were too rebellious to stay. The rock proved\\nsofter on each side of us, and so they left the centre of the river bare\\nand dry, first working out these two little holes for us to hide in.\"\\n\\n\"We are then on an island?\"\\n\\n\"Ay! there are the falls on two sides of us, and the river above and\\nbelow. If you had daylight, it would be worth the trouble to step up on\\nthe height of this rock, and look at the perversity of the water. It\\nfalls by no rule at all; sometimes it leaps, sometimes it tumbles;\\nthere, it skips; here, it shoots; in one place \\'tis white as snow, and\\nin another \\'tis green as grass; hereabouts, it pitches into deep\\nhollows, that rumble and quake the \\'arth; and hereaway, it ripples and\\nsings like a brook, fashioning whirlpools and gulleys in the old stone,\\nas it \\'twas no harder than trodden clay. The whole design of the river\\nseems disconcerted. First it runs smoothly, as if meaning to go down the\\ndescent as things were ordered; then it angles about and faces the\\nshores; nor are there places wanting where it looks backward, as if\\nunwilling to leave the wilderness, to mingle with the salt! Ay, lady,\\nthe fine cobweb-looking cloth you wear at your throat, is coarse, and\\nlike a fish-net, to little spots I can show you, where the river\\nfabricates all sorts of images, as if, having broke loose from order, it\\nwould try its hand at everything. And yet what does it amount to! After\\nthe water has been suffered to have its will, for a time, like a\\nheadstrong man, it is gathered together by the hand that made it, and a\\nfew rods below you may see it all, flowing on steadily towards the sea,\\nas was foreordained from the first foundation of the \\'arth!\"\\n\\nWhile his auditors received a cheering assurance of the security of\\ntheir place of concealment, from this untutored description of\\nGlenn\\'s,[13] they were much inclined to judge differently from Hawkeye,\\nof its wild beauties. But they were not in a situation to suffer their\\nthoughts to dwell on the charms of natural objects; and, as the scout\\nhad not found it necessary to cease his culinary labors while he spoke,\\nunless to point out, with a broken fork, the direction of some\\nparticularly obnoxious point in the rebellious stream, they now suffered\\ntheir attention to be drawn to the necessary, though more vulgar\\nconsideration of their supper.\\n\\nThe repast, which was greatly aided by the addition of a few delicacies\\nthat Heyward had the precaution to bring with him when they left their\\nhorses, was exceedingly refreshing to the wearied party. Uncas acted as\\nattendant to the females, performing all the little offices within his\\npower, with a mixture of dignity and anxious grace, that served to amuse\\nHeyward, who well knew that it was an utter innovation on the Indian\\ncustoms, which forbid their warriors to descend to any menial\\nemployment, especially in favor of their women. As the rites of\\nhospitality were, however, considered sacred among them, this little\\ndeparture from the dignity of manhood excited no audible comment. Had\\nthere been one there sufficiently disengaged to become a close observer,\\nhe might have fancied that the services of the young chief were not\\nentirely impartial. That while he tendered to Alice the gourd of sweet\\nwater and the venison in a trencher, neatly carved from the knot of the\\npepperidge, with sufficient courtesy, in performing the same offices to\\nher sister, his dark eye lingered on her rich, speaking countenance.\\nOnce or twice he was compelled to speak, to command the attention of\\nthose he served. In such cases, he made use of English, broken and\\nimperfect, but sufficiently intelligible, and which he rendered so mild\\nand musical, by his deep,[14] guttural voice, that it never failed to\\ncause both ladies to look up in admiration and astonishment. In the\\ncourse of these civilities, a few sentences were exchanged, that served\\nto establish the appearance of an amicable intercourse between the\\nparties.\\n\\nIn the meanwhile, the gravity of Chingachgook remained immovable. He had\\nseated himself more within the circle of light, where the frequent\\nuneasy glances of his guests were better enabled to separate the natural\\nexpression of his face from the artificial terrors of the war-paint.\\nThey found a strong resemblance between father and son, with the\\ndifference that might be expected from age and hardships. The fierceness\\nof his countenance now seemed to slumber, and in its place was to be\\nseen the quiet, vacant composure, which distinguishes an Indian warrior,\\nwhen his faculties are not required for any of the greater purposes of\\nhis existence. It was, however, easy to be seen, by the occasional\\ngleams that shot across his swarthy visage, that it was only necessary\\nto arouse his passions, in order to give full effect to the terrific\\ndevice which he had adopted to intimidate his enemies. On the other\\nhand, the quick, roving eye of the scout seldom rested. He ate and drank\\nwith an appetite that no sense of danger could disturb, but his\\nvigilance seemed never to desert him. Twenty times the gourd or the\\nvenison was suspended before his lips, while his head was turned aside,\\nas though he listened to some distant and distrusted sounds--a movement\\nthat never failed to recall his guests from regarding the novelties of\\ntheir situation, to a recollection of the alarming reasons that had\\ndriven them to seek it. As these frequent pauses were never followed by\\nany remark, the momentary uneasiness they created quickly passed away,\\nand for a time was forgotten.\\n\\n\"Come, friend,\" said Hawkeye, drawing out a keg from beneath a cover of\\nleaves, towards the close of the repast, and addressing the stranger who\\nsat at his elbow, doing great justice to his culinary skill, \"try a\\nlittle spruce; \\'twill wash away all thoughts of the colt, and quicken\\nthe life in your bosom. I drink to our better friendship, hoping that a\\nlittle horse-flesh may leave no heartburnings atween us. How do you name\\nyourself?\"\\n\\n\"Gamut--David Gamut,\" returned the singing-master, preparing to wash\\ndown his sorrows in a powerful draught of the woodman\\'s high-flavored\\nand well-laced compound.\\n\\n\"A very good name, and, I dare say, handed down from honest\\nforefathers. I\\'m an admirator of names, though the Christian fashions\\nfall far below savage customs in this particular. The biggest coward I\\never knew was called Lyon; and his wife, Patience, would scold you out\\nof hearing in less time than a hunted deer would run a rod. With an\\nIndian \\'tis a matter of conscience; what he calls himself, he generally\\nis--not that Chingachgook, which signifies Big Sarpent, is really a\\nsnake, big or little; but that he understands the windings and turnings\\nof human natur\\', and is silent, and strikes his enemies when they least\\nexpect him. What may be your calling?\"\\n\\n\"I am an unworthy instructor in the art of psalmody.\"\\n\\n\"Anan!\"\\n\\n\"I teach singing to the youths, of the Connecticut levy.\"\\n\\n\"You might be better employed. The young hounds go laughing and singing\\ntoo much already through the woods, when they ought not to breathe\\nlouder than a fox in his cover. Can you use the smooth bore, or handle\\nthe rifle?\"\\n\\n\"Praised be God, I have never had occasion to meddle with murderous\\nimplements!\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps you understand the compass, and lay down the water-courses and\\nmountains of the wilderness on paper, in order that they who follow may\\nfind places by their given names?\"\\n\\n\"I practise no such employment.\"\\n\\n\"You have a pair of legs that might make a long path seem short! you\\njourney sometimes, I fancy, with tidings for the general.\"\\n\\n\"Never; I follow no other than my own high vocation, which is\\ninstruction in sacred music!\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis a strange calling!\" muttered Hawkeye, with an inward laugh, \"to go\\nthrough life, like a catbird, mocking all the ups and downs that may\\nhappen to come out of other men\\'s throats. Well, friend, I suppose it is\\nyour gift, and mustn\\'t be denied any more than if \\'twas shooting, or\\nsome other better inclination. Let us hear what you can do in that way;\\n\\'twill be a friendly manner of saying good-night, for \\'tis time that\\nthese ladies should be getting strength for a hard and a long push, in\\nthe pride of the morning, afore the Maquas are stirring!\"\\n\\n\"With joyful pleasure do I consent,\" said David, adjusting his\\niron-rimmed spectacles, and producing his beloved little volume, which\\nhe immediately tendered to Alice. \"What can be more fitting and\\nconsolatory, than to offer up evening praise, after a day of such\\nexceeding jeopardy!\"\\n\\nAlice smiled; but regarding Heyward, she blushed and hesitated.\\n\\n\"Indulge yourself,\" he whispered: \"ought not the suggestion of the\\nworthy namesake of the Psalmist to have its weight at such a moment?\"\\n\\nEncouraged by his opinion, Alice did what her pious inclinations and her\\nkeen relish for gentle sounds, had before so strongly urged. The book\\nwas open at a hymn not ill adapted to their situation, and in which the\\npoet, no longer goaded by his desire to excel the inspired king of\\nIsrael, had discovered some chastened and respectable powers. Cora\\nbetrayed a disposition to support her sister, and the sacred song\\nproceeded, after the indispensable preliminaries of the pitch-pipe and\\nthe tune had been duly attended to by the methodical David.\\n\\nThe air was solemn and slow. At times it rose to the fullest compass of\\nthe rich voices of the females, who hung over their little book in holy\\nexcitement, and again it sank so low, that the rushing of the waters ran\\nthrough their melody, like a hollow accompaniment. The natural taste and\\ntrue ear of David governed and modified the sounds to suit the confined\\ncavern, every crevice, and cranny of which was filled with the thrilling\\nnotes of their flexible voices. The Indians riveted their eyes on the\\nrocks, and listened with an attention that seemed to turn them into\\nstone. But the scout, who had placed his chin in his hand, with an\\nexpression of cold indifference, gradually suffered his rigid features\\nto relax, until, as verse succeeded verse, he felt his iron nature\\nsubdued, while his recollection was carried back to boyhood, when his\\nears had been accustomed to listen to similar sounds of praise, in the\\nsettlements of the colony. His roving eyes began to moisten, and before\\nthe hymn was ended, scalding tears rolled out of fountains that had long\\nseemed dry, and followed each other down those cheeks, that had oftener\\nfelt the storms of heaven than any testimonials of weakness. The singers\\nwere dwelling on one of those low, dying chords, which the ear devours\\nwith such greedy rapture, as if conscious that it is about to lose them,\\nwhen a cry, that seemed neither human nor earthly, rose in the outward\\nair, penetrating not only the recesses of the cavern, but to the inmost\\nhearts of all who heard it. It was followed by a stillness apparently as\\ndeep as if the waters had been checked in their furious progress, at\\nsuch a horrid and unusual interruption.\\n\\n\"What is it?\" murmured Alice, after a few moments of terrible suspense.\\n\\n\"What is it?\" repeated Heyward aloud.\\n\\nNeither Hawkeye nor the Indians made any reply. They listened, as if\\nexpecting the sound would be repeated, with a manner that expressed\\ntheir own astonishment. At length they spoke together earnestly, in the\\nDelaware language, when Uncas, passing by the inner and most concealed\\naperture, cautiously left the cavern. When he had gone, the scout first\\nspoke in English.\\n\\n\"What it is, or what it is not, none here can tell; though two of us\\nhave ranged the woods for more than thirty years! I did believe there\\nwas no cry that Indians or beast could make, that my ears had not heard;\\nbut this has proved that I was only a vain and conceited mortal!\"\\n\\n\"Was it not, then, the shout the warriors make when they wish to\\nintimidate their enemies?\" asked Cora, who stood drawing her veil about\\nher person, with a calmness to which her agitated sister was a stranger.\\n\\n\"No, no; this was bad, and shocking, and had a sort of unhuman sound;\\nbut when you once hear the war-whoop, you will never mistake it for\\nanything else! Well, Uncas!\" speaking in Delaware to the young chief as\\nhe re-entered, \"what see you? do our lights shine through the blankets?\"\\n\\nThe answer was short, and apparently decided, being given in the same\\ntongue.\\n\\n\"There is nothing to be seen without,\" continued Hawkeye, shaking his\\nhead in discontent; \"and our hiding-place is still in darkness! Pass\\ninto the other cave, you that need it, and seek for sleep; we must be\\nafoot long before the sun, and make the most of our time to get to\\nEdward, while the Mingos are taking their morning nap.\"\\n\\nCora set the example of compliance, with a steadiness that taught the\\nmore timid Alice the necessity of obedience. Before leaving the place,\\nhowever, she whispered a request to Duncan that he would follow. Uncas\\nraised the blanket for their passage, and as the sisters turned to thank\\nhim for this act of attention, they saw the scout seated again before\\nthe dying embers, with his face resting on his hands, in a manner which\\nshowed how deeply he brooded on the unaccountable interruption which\\nhad broken up their evening devotions.\\n\\nHeyward took with him a blazing knot, which threw a dim light through\\nthe narrow vista of their new apartment. Placing it in a favorable\\nposition, he joined the females, who now found themselves alone with him\\nfor the first time since they had left the friendly ramparts of Fort\\nEdward.\\n\\n\"Leave us not, Duncan,\" said Alice; \"we cannot sleep in such a place as\\nthis, with that horrid cry still ringing in our ears!\"\\n\\n\"First let us examine into the security of your fortress,\" he answered,\\n\"and then we will speak of rest.\"\\n\\nHe approached the farther end of the cavern, to an outlet, which, like\\nthe others, was concealed by blankets, and removing the thick screen,\\nbreathed the fresh and reviving air from the cataract. One arm of the\\nriver flowed through a deep, narrow ravine, which its current had worn\\nin the soft rock, directly beneath his feet, forming an effectual\\ndefence, as he believed, against any danger from that quarter; the\\nwater, a few rods above them, plunging, glancing, and sweeping along, in\\nits most violent and broken manner.\\n\\n\"Nature has made an impenetrable barrier on this side,\" he continued,\\npointing down the perpendicular declivity into the dark current, before\\nhe dropped the blanket; \"and as you know that good men and true are on\\nguard in front, I see no reason why the advice of our honest host should\\nbe disregarded. I am certain Cora will join me in saying that sleep is\\nnecessary to you both.\"\\n\\n\"Cora may submit to the justice of your opinion, though she cannot put\\nit in practise,\" returned the elder sister, who had placed herself by\\nthe side of Alice, on a couch of sassafras; \"there would be other causes\\nto chase away sleep, though we had been spared the shock of this\\nmysterious noise. Ask yourself, Heyward, can daughters forget the\\nanxiety a father must endure, whose children lodge, he knows not where\\nor how, in such a wilderness, and in the midst of so many perils?\"\\n\\n\"He is a soldier, and knows how to estimate the chances of the woods.\"\\n\\n\"He is a father, and cannot deny his nature.\"\\n\\n\"How kind has he ever been to all my follies! how tender and indulgent\\nto all my wishes!\" sobbed Alice. \"We have been selfish, sister, in\\nurging our visit at such hazard!\"\\n\\n\"I may have been rash in pressing his consent in a moment of much\\nembarrassment, but I would have proved to him, that however others might\\nneglect him in his strait, his children at least were faithful!\"\\n\\n\"When he heard of your arrival at Edward,\" said Heyward, kindly, \"there\\nwas a powerful struggle in his bosom between fear and love; though the\\nlatter, heightened, if possible, by so long a separation, quickly\\nprevailed. \\'It is the spirit of my noble-minded Cora that leads them,\\nDuncan,\\' he said, \\'and I will not balk it. Would to God, that he who\\nholds the honor of our royal master in his guardianship, would show but\\nhalf her firmness!\\'\"\\n\\n\"And did he not speak of me, Heyward?\" demanded Alice, with jealous\\naffection. \"Surely, he forgot not altogether his little Elsie?\"\\n\\n\"That was impossible,\" returned the young man; \"he called you by a\\nthousand endearing epithets, that I may not presume to use, but to the\\njustice of which I can warmly testify. Once, indeed, he said--\"\\n\\nDuncan ceased speaking; for while his eyes were riveted on those of\\nAlice, who had turned towards him with the eagerness of filial\\naffection, to catch his words, the same strong horrid cry, as before,\\nfilled the air, and rendered him mute. A long, breathless silence\\nsucceeded, during which each looked at the others in fearful expectation\\nof hearing the sound repeated. At length the blanket was slowly raised,\\nand the scout stood in the aperture with a countenance whose firmness\\nevidently began to give way, before a mystery that seemed to threaten\\nsome danger, against which all his cunning and experience might prove of\\nno avail.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "    'summary_text': 'Heyward and the girls are uneasy and Gamut is still struggling in spirit when a light flashes upon them and they see that the others have entered a cavern hidden by a blanket. Hawkeye is holding a blazing knot of pine which silhouettes Uncas, the first clear sight of whose carriage and almost Grecian features relieves the lingering doubts of those from Fort Edward. When the latter also enter the cavern, they learn that at the other entrance is a narrow, open chasm running at right angles and that just beyond it is another cave. They are essentially on an island of rock with the falls and turbulent water on both sides. As they take their meal of venison, Uncas makes an innovation on his Indian customs by attending the females, betraying a bit more interest in Cora than in Alice. In spite of his continuous vigilance, Hawkeye draws out a keg and invites Gamut to \"try a little spruce.\" After they discuss Gamut\\'s name and profession, the psalmodist and the girls render a sacred number that is safely muffled by the noise of the falls. The memory of his boyhood in the settlements brings tears to the scout\\'s eyes just as the song is interrupted by a sudden, unearthly cry. In the ensuing stillness, Uncas cautiously steps outside but can see nothing to identify the unknown sound. Heyward takes the girls into the inner cave for sleep and inspects the far entrance to find directly beneath his feet an impenetrable barrier of roiling water. Though yet stoical, Cora seems for the first time to feel it rash to be trying to visit their father during this crisis. Heyward is reassuring the girls about Munro\\'s feelings for them when the horrid cry fills the air again. Within a moment, the blanket-entrance is raised and the scout stands there, his face reflecting everyone\\'s fearful sense of mystery and his own growing dismay.',\n",
       "    'summary_analysis': 'This chapter shows Cooper in his most inventive, dramatic, and descriptive form. His sympathy and admiration for the good Indians ring through his own delineations and the appreciative words of Heyward, Alice, and Cora. By putting the poetic description of the island and falls into the mouth of Hawkeye, he reveals his deep respect for and clear knowledge of nature and at the same time deepens the characterization of the scout, whose sense of justice, relativity, and \"place\" is again highlighted when he admits that Gamut\\'s \"strange calling\" is his \"gift\" and must not be denied. Completing and technically sustaining these developments are the plot elements of suspense and exploration of locale. Preparation for future thematic plot complications is smooth and unobtrusive in Uncas\\' brief attention to Cora.',\n",

As Heyward remarks upon the loveliness of the scene, the horrifying sound comes again as if from the bed of the river, and Heyward now recognizes it as the shriek of a horse in terror. The scout\\'s reckoning that the horses are frightened by hovering wolves is immediately confirmed by a long howl that swiftly recedes into the depths of the forest, an abandonment that indicates enemy Indians are near. Once again secure in his knowledge of things, Hawkeye directs everyone to hide in moon shadows where they have a full view of both shores. Hours pass, and all fall asleep except the ever watchful scout and the Mohicans. The moon sets, and as pale dawn begins, the Iroquois attack with hellish yells and rifle reports. Gamut exposes himself, is wounded, and falls unconscious, while Hawkeye slips below and shoots one enemy, afterwards saying that their only hope is to hold the rock until Munro sends a party to help them. Heyward takes the girls into the outer cave where the reviving Gamut has been taken. As Cora reminds him how much his safety means to them, the major glances at Alice, reassures them, and rejoins the others outside. He and the scout deploy themselves in a little thicket of pines below the rock that splits the falls. Dawn comes. Then a long, anxious, and quiet watch succeeds until Hawkeye detects that four Indians have swum dangerously down to the rock above the defenders. As they wait, a fifth one, struggling to reach the rock, is thrown into the air and over the falls with a single, despairing shriek. After whistling Uncas to them, Hawkeye and the warrior shoot two Indians as the four charge them. When Heyward\\'s pistols misfire, he and the scout grapple hand-to-hand with the two remaining enemies until Hawkeye dispatches his foe with a knife. Heyward is about to be dragged over the precipice with the other when Uncas severs the tendons of the Iroquois\\' wrist and grabs Heyward as the wounded savage falls to his destruction. As the survivors take cover, the Indians on shore yell and fire, and a give-and-take battle begins. One Iroquois, who has climbed an oak tree near shore, fires down upon the protagonists and slightly wounds Heyward. Setting up a crossfire with Chingachgook, Hawkeye fires his rifle \\\\\"Killdeer\\\\\" and wounds the savage, who is left swinging in the wind with a desperate grasp on a branch. To save powder, the scout refuses to show mercy and finish the kill, but he weakens and discharges his last powder and bullet as the man falls toward the rocks and water. Uncas goes for munitions in the canoe only to find an Indian swimming away with it. Now essentially bereft of defensive means, the Mohicans scoff at their enemies and prepare for death. Hawkeye is quietly and stoically preparing himself also when Cora, who has been brave all along, entreats the men to escape downstream and effect a rescue. Convinced of her reason, Chingachgook slips under the water and away. After telling her to leave a marked trail if they are captured, Hawkeye carefully lays \\\\\"Killdeer\\\\\" aside and disappears into the water. Uncas remains until Cora, lowering her eyes, asks him to go to her father as her \\\\\"most confidential\\\\\" messenger; then he also drops into the water. When Heyward refuses to leave on the grounds that his presence may keep the girls from evils worse than death, Cora draws \\\\\"the nearly insensible Alice after her into the deepest recess of the inner cavern.\\\\\"\", \"analysis\": \"While outwardly these two chapters are concerned chiefly with fright and action for entertaining the reader and multiplying difficulties for the characters, it also portrays the bloody cross-purposes of frontier strife: seven Iroquois are killed and two white men are wounded, while the male protagonists are finally confronted with a moral dilemma. Are they to face danger and probable death with calm, frontal bravery, or are they to turn to subterfuge and escape, hoping to effect a rescue but running the risk of being deserters? It is a bigger problem than that found in most sentimental novels, where woman\\'s greatest threat is usually to her virtue or reputation. Here it involves the age-old physical responsibility of the male for the female and -- greater yet -- of the strong for the weak, the typical assumption in the myth of the American frontiersman. The decision and resultant escape of Hawkeye, whose Christian reasoning is notably different from that of the Mohicans, is of a piece with the American self-ideal about necessity and the ingenuity of \\\\\"finding a way out.\\\\\" The fortitude of Cora at this point is also consistent with the accredited strength of American pioneer womanhood; it is she who sees beyond the immediate grave situation to a possible desperate solution for which she femininely entreats rather than insists. Further, though Cooper\\'s females only seldom do so, in this instance Cora takes on the three-dimensional qualities of a real woman character when, revealing a bit of her personal feelings and utilizing Uncas\\', she urges the subtle distinction about messengers which leads the young Mohican to escape also. At his best, Cooper is not a novelist who presses his thematic elements very hard upon his reader. But the preceding elements are in these two chapters, and so are others such as the rifle lore that Hawkeye voices during the battles. The two white men from Fort Edward are significantly wounded in this raw frontier condition that is new to them. Although as yet unaware of it, Gamut is already confronting what Hawkeye knows and, after the psalmodist is unconscious, voices: that \\\\\"singing won\\'t do any good with the Iroquois.\\\\\" Thus in the singing master, religious idealism and reality are meeting head-on. Also, Cooper is very slowly and carefully developing the attraction between Uncas and Cora. The surplus sentimental heroine is gradually being paired with a hero, but it is an original pairing that involves the conservative idea of racial \\\\\"place\\\\\" and is to result in tragic complications. While the story moves along at a brisk pace with action and Indian customs such as the preparation for dying, Cooper is touching upon and getting ready to develop further more crucial aspects of the frontier situation in the New World.\"}',\n",
       "    'chapter': '\\n                  \"They do not sleep.\\n  On yonder cliffs, a grisly band,\\n  I see them sit.\"\\n\\n  GRAY.\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Twould be neglecting a warning that is given for our good, to lie hid\\nany longer,\" said Hawkeye, \"when such sounds are raised in the forest!\\nThe gentle ones may keep close, but the Mohicans and I will watch upon\\nthe rock, where I suppose a major of the 60th would wish to keep us\\ncompany.\"\\n\\n\"Is then our danger so pressing?\" asked Cora.\\n\\n\"He who makes strange sounds, and gives them out for man\\'s information,\\nalone knows our danger. I should think myself wicked, unto rebellion\\nagainst his will, was I to burrow with such warnings in the air! Even\\nthe weak soul who passes his days in singing, is stirred by the cry,\\nand, as he says, is \\'ready to go forth to the battle.\\' If \\'twere only a\\nbattle, it would be a thing understood by us all, and easily managed;\\nbut I have heard that when such shrieks are atween heaven and \\'arth, it\\nbetokens another sort of warfare!\"\\n\\n\"If all our reasons for fear, my friend, are confined to such as proceed\\nfrom supernatural causes, we have but little occasion to be alarmed,\"\\ncontinued the undisturbed Cora; \"are you certain that our enemies have\\nnot invented some new and ingenious method to strike us with terror,\\nthat their conquest may become more easy?\"\\n\\n\"Lady,\" returned the scout, solemnly, \"I have listened to all the sounds\\nof the woods for thirty years, as a man will listen, whose life and\\ndeath depend on the quickness of his ears. There is no whine of the\\npanther, no whistle of the catbird, nor any invention of the devilish\\nMingos, that can cheat me! I have heard the forest moan like mortal men\\nin their affliction; often, and again, have I listened to the wind\\nplaying its music in the branches of the girdled trees; and I have heard\\nthe lightning cracking in the air, like the snapping of blazing brush,\\nas it spitted forth sparks and forked flames; but never have I thought\\nthat I heard more than the pleasure of Him who sported with the things\\nof his hand. But neither the Mohicans, nor I, who am a white man without\\na cross, can explain the cry just heard. We, therefore, believe it a\\nsign given for our good.\"\\n\\n\"It is extraordinary!\" said Heyward, taking his pistols from the place\\nwhere he had laid them on entering; \"be it a sign of peace or a signal\\nof war, it must be looked to. Lead the way, my friend; I follow.\"\\n\\nOn issuing from their place of confinement, the whole party instantly\\nexperienced a grateful renovation of spirits, by exchanging the pent air\\nof the hiding-place for the cool and invigorating atmosphere, which\\nplayed around the whirlpools and pitches of the cataract. A heavy\\nevening breeze swept along the surface of the river, and seemed to drive\\nthe roar of the falls into the recesses of their own caverns, whence it\\nissued heavily and constant, like thunder rumbling beyond the distant\\nhills. The moon had risen, and its light was already glancing here and\\nthere on the waters above them; but the extremity of the rock where they\\nstood still lay in shadow. With the exception of the sounds produced by\\nthe rushing waters, and an occasional breathing of the air, as it\\nmurmured past them in fitful currents, the scene was as still as night\\nand solitude could make it. In vain were the eyes of each individual\\nbent along the opposite shores, in quest of some signs of life, that\\nmight explain the nature of the interruption they had heard. Their\\nanxious and eager looks were baffled by the deceptive light, or rested\\nonly on naked rocks, and straight and immovable trees.\\n\\n\"There is nothing to be seen but the gloom and quiet of a lovely\\nevening,\" whispered Duncan: \"how much should we prize such a scene, and\\nall this breathing solitude, at any other moment, Cora! Fancy yourselves\\nin security and what now, perhaps, increases your terror, may be made\\nconducive to enjoyment--\"\\n\\n\"Listen!\" interrupted Alice.\\n\\nThe caution was unnecessary. Once more the same sound arose, as if from\\nthe bed of the river, and having broken out of the narrow bounds of the\\ncliffs, was heard undulating through the forest, in distant and dying\\ncadences.\\n\\n\"Can any here give a name to such a cry?\" demanded Hawkeye, when the\\nlast echo was lost in the woods; \"if so, let him speak; for myself, I\\njudge it not to belong to \\'arth!\"\\n\\n\"Here, then, is one who can undeceive you,\" said Duncan; \"I know the\\nsound full well, for often have I heard it on the field of battle, and\\nin situations which are frequent in a soldier\\'s life. \\'Tis the horrid\\nshriek that a horse will give in his agony; oftener drawn from him in\\npain, though sometimes in terror. My charger is either a prey to the\\nbeasts of the forest, or he sees his danger, without the power to avoid\\nit. The sound might deceive me in the cavern, but in the open air I know\\nit too well to be wrong.\"\\n\\nThe scout and his companions listened to this simple explanation with\\nthe interest of men who imbibe new ideas, at the same time that they get\\nrid of old ones, which had proved disagreeable inmates. The two latter\\nuttered their usual and expressive exclamation, \"Hugh!\" as the truth\\nfirst glanced upon their minds, while the former, after a short musing\\npause, took upon himself to reply.\\n\\n\"I cannot deny your words,\" he said; \"for I am little skilled in horses,\\nthough born where they abound. The wolves must be hovering above their\\nheads on the bank, and the timorsome creatures are calling on man for\\nhelp, in the best manner they are able. Uncas,\"--he spoke in\\nDelaware--\"Uncas, drop down in the canoe, and whirl a brand among the\\npack; or fear may do what the wolves can\\'t get at to perform, and leave\\nus without horses in the morning, when we shall have so much need to\\njourney swiftly!\"\\n\\nThe young native had already descended to the water, to comply, when a\\nlong howl was raised on the edge of the river, and was borne swiftly off\\ninto the depths of the forest, as though the beasts, of their own\\naccord, were abandoning their prey in sudden terror. Uncas, with\\ninstinctive quickness, receded, and the three foresters held another of\\ntheir low, earnest conferences.\\n\\n\"We have been like hunters who have lost the points of the heavens, and\\nfrom whom the sun has been hid for days,\" said Hawkeye, turning away\\nfrom his companions; \"now we begin again to know the signs of our\\ncourse, and the paths are cleared from briers! Seat yourselves in the\\nshade which the moon throws from yonder beech--\\'tis thicker than that of\\nthe pines--and let us wait for that which the Lord may choose to send\\nnext. Let all your conversation be in whispers; though it would be\\nbetter, and perhaps, in the end, wiser, if each one held discourse with\\nhis own thoughts, for a time.\"\\n\\nThe manner of the scout was seriously impressive, though no longer\\ndistinguished by any signs of unmanly apprehension. It was evident that\\nhis momentary weakness had vanished with the explanation of a mystery\\nwhich his own experience had not served to fathom; and though he now\\nfelt all the realities of their actual condition, that he was prepared\\nto meet them with the energy of his hardy nature. This feeling seemed\\nalso common to the natives, who placed themselves in positions which\\ncommanded a full view of both shores, while their own persons were\\neffectually concealed from observation. In such circumstances, common\\nprudence dictated that Heyward and his companions should imitate a\\ncaution that proceeded from so intelligent a source. The young man drew\\na pile of the sassafras from the cave, and placing it in the chasm which\\nseparated the two caverns, it was occupied by the sisters, who were thus\\nprotected by the rocks from any missiles, while their anxiety was\\nrelieved by the assurance that no danger could approach without a\\nwarning. Heyward himself was posted at hand, so near that he might\\ncommunicate with his companions without raising his voice to a dangerous\\nelevation, while David, in imitation of the woodsmen, bestowed his\\nperson in such a manner among the fissures of the rocks, that his\\nungainly limbs were no longer offensive to the eye.\\n\\nIn this manner, hours passed by without further interruption. The moon\\nreached the zenith, and shed its mild light perpendicularly on the\\nlovely sight of the sisters slumbering peacefully in each other\\'s arms.\\nDuncan cast the wide shawl of Cora before a spectacle he so much loved\\nto contemplate, and then suffered his own head to seek a pillow on the\\nrock. David began to utter sounds that would have shocked his delicate\\norgans in more wakeful moments; in short, all but Hawkeye and the\\nMohicans lost every idea of consciousness, in uncontrollable drowsiness.\\nBut the watchfulness of these vigilant protectors neither tired nor\\nslumbered. Immovable as that rock, of which each appeared to form a\\npart, they lay, with their eyes roving, without intermission, along the\\ndark margin of trees that bounded the adjacent shores of the narrow\\nstream. Not a sound escaped them; the most subtle examination could not\\nhave told they breathed. It was evident that this excess of caution\\nproceeded from an experience that no subtlety on the part of their\\nenemies could deceive. It was, however, continued without any apparent\\nconsequences, until the moon had set, and a pale streak above the\\ntree-tops, at the bend of the river a little below, announced the\\napproach of day.\\n\\nThen, for the first time, Hawkeye was seen to stir. He crawled along\\nthe rock, and shook Duncan from his heavy slumbers.\\n\\n\"Now is the time to journey,\" he whispered; \"awake the gentle ones, and\\nbe ready to get into the canoe when I bring it to the landing-place.\"\\n\\n\"Have you had a quiet night?\" said Heyward; \"for myself, I believe sleep\\nhas got the better of my vigilance.\"\\n\\n\"All is yet still as midnight. Be silent, but be quick.\"\\n\\nBy this time Duncan was thoroughly awake, and he immediately lifted the\\nshawl from the sleeping females. The motion caused Cora to raise her\\nhand as if to repulse him, while Alice murmured, in her soft, gentle\\nvoice, \"No, no, dear father, we were not deserted; Duncan was with us!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sweet innocence,\" whispered the youth; \"Duncan is here, and while\\nlife continues or danger remains, he will never quit thee. Cora! Alice!\\nawake! The hour has come to move!\"\\n\\nA loud shriek from the younger of the sisters, and the form of the other\\nstanding upright before him, in bewildered horror, was the unexpected\\nanswer he received. While the words were still on the lips of Heyward,\\nthere had arisen such a tumult of yells and cries as served to drive the\\nswift currents of his own blood back from its bounding course into the\\nfountains of his heart. It seemed, for near a minute, as if demons of\\nhell had possessed themselves of the air about them, and were venting\\ntheir savage humors in barbarous sounds. The cries came from no\\nparticular direction, though it was evident they filled the woods, and\\nas the appalled listeners easily imagined, the caverns of the falls, the\\nrocks, the bed of the river, and the upper air. David raised his tall\\nperson in the midst of the infernal din, with a hand on either ear,\\nexclaiming--\\n\\n\"Whence comes this discord! Has hell broke loose, that man should utter\\nsounds like these!\"\\n\\nThe bright flashes and the quick reports of a dozen rifles, from the\\nopposite banks of the stream, followed this incautious exposure of his\\nperson, and left the unfortunate singing-master senseless on that rock\\nwhere he had been so long slumbering. The Mohicans boldly sent back the\\nintimidating yell of their enemies, who raised a shout of savage triumph\\nat the fall of Gamut. The flash of rifles was then quick and close\\nbetween them, but either party was too well skilled to leave even a limb\\nexposed to the hostile aim. Duncan listened with intense anxiety for\\nthe strokes of the paddle, believing that flight was now their only\\nrefuge. The river glanced by with its ordinary velocity, but the canoe\\nwas nowhere to be seen on its dark waters. He had just fancied they were\\ncruelly deserted by the scout, as a stream of flame issued from the rock\\nbeneath him, and a fierce yell, blended with a shriek of agony,\\nannounced that the messenger of death, sent from the fatal weapon of\\nHawkeye, had found a victim. At this slight repulse the assailants\\ninstantly withdrew, and gradually the place became as still as before\\nthe sudden tumult.\\n\\nDuncan seized the favorable moment to spring to the body of Gamut, which\\nhe bore within the shelter of the narrow chasm that protected the\\nsisters. In another minute the whole party was collected in this spot of\\ncomparative safety.\\n\\n\"The poor fellow has saved his scalp,\" said Hawkeye, coolly passing his\\nhand over the head of David; \"but he is a proof that a man may be born\\nwith too long a tongue! \\'Twas downright madness to show six feet of\\nflesh and blood, on a naked rock, to the raging savages. I only wonder\\nhe has escaped with life.\"\\n\\n\"Is he not dead!\" demanded Cora, in a voice whose husky tones showed how\\npowerfully natural horror struggled with her assumed firmness. \"Can we\\ndo aught to assist the wretched man?\"\\n\\n\"No, no! the life is in his heart yet, and after he has slept awhile he\\nwill come to himself, and be a wiser man for it, till the hour of his\\nreal time shall come,\" returned Hawkeye, casting another oblique glance\\nat the insensible body, while he filled his charger with admirable\\nnicety. \"Carry him in, Uncas, and lay him on the sassafras. The longer\\nhis nap lasts the better it will be for him, as I doubt whether he can\\nfind a proper cover for such a shape on these rocks; and singing won\\'t\\ndo any good with the Iroquois.\"\\n\\n\"You believe, then, the attack will be renewed?\" asked Heyward.\\n\\n\"Do I expect a hungry wolf will satisfy his craving with a mouthful!\\nThey have lost a man, and \\'tis their fashion, when they meet a loss, and\\nfail in the surprise, to fall back; but we shall have them on again,\\nwith new expedients to circumvent us, and master our scalps. Our main\\nhope,\" he continued, raising his rugged countenance, across which a\\nshade of anxiety just then passed like a darkening cloud, \"will be to\\nkeep the rock until Munro can send a party to our help! God send it may\\nbe soon, and under a leader that knows the Indian customs!\"\\n\\n\"You hear our probable fortunes, Cora,\" said Duncan, \"and you know we\\nhave everything to hope from the anxiety and experience of your father.\\nCome, then, with Alice, into this cavern, where you, at least, will be\\nsafe from the murderous rifles of our enemies and where you may bestow a\\ncare suited to your gentle natures on our unfortunate comrade.\"\\n\\nThe sisters followed him into the outer cave, where David was beginning,\\nby his sighs, to give symptoms of returning consciousness; and then\\ncommending the wounded man to their attention, he immediately prepared\\nto leave them.\\n\\n\"Duncan!\" said the tremulous voice of Cora, when he had reached the\\nmouth of the cavern. He turned, and beheld the speaker, whose color had\\nchanged to a deadly paleness, and whose lip quivered, gazing after him,\\nwith an expression of interest which immediately recalled him to her\\nside. \"Remember, Duncan, how necessary your safety is to our own--how\\nyou bear a father\\'s sacred trust--how much depends on your discretion\\nand care--in short,\" she added, while the tell-tale blood stole over her\\nfeatures, crimsoning her very temples, \"how very deservedly dear you are\\nto all of the name of Munro.\"\\n\\n\"If anything could add to my own base love of life,\" said Heyward,\\nsuffering his unconscious eyes to wander to the youthful form of the\\nsilent Alice, \"it would be so kind an assurance. As major of the 60th,\\nour honest host will tell you I must take my share of the fray; but our\\ntask will be easy; it is merely to keep these blood-hounds at bay for a\\nfew hours.\"\\n\\nWithout waiting for reply, he tore himself from the presence of the\\nsisters, and joined the scout and his companions, who still lay within\\nthe protection of the little chasm between the two caves.\\n\\n\"I tell you, Uncas,\" said the former, as Heyward joined them, \"you are\\nwasteful of your powder, and the kick of the rifle disconcerts your aim!\\nLittle powder, light lead, and a long arm, seldom fail of bringing the\\ndeath screech from a Mingo! At least, such has been my experience with\\nthe creatur\\'s. Come, friends; let us to our covers, for no man can tell\\nwhen or where a Maqua[15] will strike his blow.\"\\n\\nThe Indians silently repaired to their appointed stations, which were\\nfissures in the rocks, whence they could command the approaches to the\\nfoot of the falls. In the centre of the little island, a few short and\\nstunted pines had found root, forming a thicket, into which Hawkeye\\ndarted with the swiftness of a deer, followed by the active Duncan. Here\\nthey secured themselves, as well as circumstances would permit, among\\nthe shrubs and fragments of stone that were scattered about the place.\\nAbove them was a bare, rounded rock, on each side of which the water\\nplayed its gambols, and plunged into the abysses beneath, in the manner\\nalready described. As the day had now dawned, the opposite shores no\\nlonger presented a confused outline, but they were able to look into the\\nwoods, and distinguish objects beneath the canopy of gloomy pines.\\n\\nA long and anxious watch succeeded, but without any further evidences of\\na renewed attack; and Duncan began to hope that their fire had proved\\nmore fatal than was supposed, and that their enemies had been\\neffectually repulsed. When he ventured to utter this impression to his\\ncompanion, it was met by Hawkeye with an incredulous shake of the head.\\n\\n\"You know not the nature of a Maqua, if you think he is so easily beaten\\nback without a scalp!\" he answered. \"If there was one of the imps\\nyelling this morning, there were forty! and they know our number and\\nquality too well to give up the chase so soon. Hist! look into the water\\nabove, just where it breaks over the rocks. I am no mortal, if the risky\\ndevils haven\\'t swam down upon the very pitch, and, as bad luck would\\nhave it, they have hit the head of the island. Hist! man, keep close! or\\nthe hair will be off your crown in the turning of a knife!\"\\n\\nHeyward lifted his head from the cover, and beheld what he justly\\nconsidered a prodigy of rashness and skill. The river had worn away the\\nedge of the soft rock in such a manner, as to render its first pitch\\nless abrupt and perpendicular than is usual at waterfalls. With no other\\nguide than the ripple of the stream where it met the head of the island,\\na party of their insatiable foes had ventured into the current, and swam\\ndown upon this point, knowing the ready access it would give, if\\nsuccessful, to their intended victims. As Hawkeye ceased speaking, four\\nhuman heads could be seen peering above a few logs of drift-wood that\\nhad lodged on these naked rocks, and which had probably suggested the\\nidea of the practicability of the hazardous undertaking. At the next\\nmoment, a fifth form was seen floating over the green edge of the fall,\\na little from the line of the island. The savage struggled powerfully to\\ngain the point of safety, and, favored by the glancing water, he was\\nalready stretching forth an arm to meet the grasp of his companions,\\nwhen he shot away again with the whirling current, appeared to rise into\\nthe air, with uplifted arms and starting eyeballs, and fell, with a\\nsullen plunge, into that deep and yawning abyss over which he hovered. A\\nsingle, wild, despairing shriek rose from the cavern, and all was hushed\\nagain, as the grave.\\n\\nThe first generous impulse of Duncan was to rush to the rescue of the\\nhapless wretch; but he felt himself bound to the spot by the iron grasp\\nof the immovable scout.\\n\\n\"Would ye bring certain death upon us, by telling the Mingos where we\\nlie?\" demanded Hawkeye, sternly; \"\\'tis a charge of powder saved, and\\nammunition is as precious now as breath to a worried deer! Freshen the\\npriming of your pistols--the mist of the falls is apt to dampen the\\nbrimstone--and stand firm for a close struggle, while I fire on their\\nrush.\"\\n\\nHe placed his finger in his mouth, and drew a long, shrill whistle,\\nwhich was answered from the rocks that were guarded by the Mohicans.\\nDuncan caught glimpses of heads above the scattered drift-wood, as this\\nsignal rose on the air, but they disappeared again as suddenly as they\\nhad glanced upon his sight. A low, rustling sound next drew his\\nattention behind him, and turning his head, he beheld Uncas within a few\\nfeet, creeping to his side. Hawkeye spoke to him in Delaware, when the\\nyoung chief took his position with singular caution and undisturbed\\ncoolness. To Heyward this was a moment of feverish and impatient\\nsuspense; though the scout saw fit to select it as a fit occasion to\\nread a lecture to his more youthful associates on the art of using\\nfire-arms with discretion.\\n\\n\"Of all we\\'pons,\" he commenced, \"the long-barrelled, true-grooved,\\nsoft-metalled rifle is the most dangerous in skilful hands, though it\\nwants a strong arm, a quick eye, and great judgment in charging, to put\\nforth all its beauties. The gunsmiths can have but little insight into\\ntheir trade, when they make their fowling-pieces and short horsemen\\'s--\"\\n\\nHe was interrupted by the low but expressive \"Hugh!\" of Uncas.\\n\\n[Illustration: _Copyright by Charles Scribner\\'s Sons_\\n\\nTHE BATTLE AT GLENS FALLS\\n\\n_Each of the combatants threw all his energies into that effort, and the\\nresult was, that both tottered on the brink of the precipice_]\\n\\n\"I see them, boy, I see them!\" continued Hawkeye; \"they are gathering\\nfor the rush, or they would keep their dingy backs below the logs. Well,\\nlet them,\" he added, examining his flint; \"the leading man certainly\\ncomes on to his death, though it should be Montcalm himself!\"\\n\\nAt that moment the woods were filled with another burst of cries, and at\\nthe signal four savages sprang from the cover of the drift-wood. Heyward\\nfelt a burning desire to rush forward to meet them, so intense was the\\ndelirious anxiety of the moment; but he was restrained by the deliberate\\nexamples of the scout and Uncas. When their foes who leaped over the\\nblack rock that divided them, with long bounds, uttering the wildest\\nyells, were within a few rods, the rifle of Hawkeye slowly rose among\\nthe shrubs, and poured out its fatal contents. The foremost Indian\\nbounded like a stricken deer, and fell headlong among the clefts of the\\nisland.\\n\\n\"Now, Uncas!\" cried the scout, drawing his long knife, while his quick\\neyes began to flash with ardor, \"take the last of the screeching imps;\\nof the other two we are sartain!\"\\n\\nHe was obeyed; and but two enemies remained to be overcome. Heyward had\\ngiven one of his pistols to Hawkeye, and together they rushed down a\\nlittle declivity towards their foes; they discharged their weapons at\\nthe same instant, and equally without success.\\n\\n\"I know\\'d it! and I said it!\" muttered the scout, whirling the despised\\nlittle implement over the falls with bitter disdain. \"Come on, ye bloody\\nminded hell-hounds! ye meet a man without a cross!\"\\n\\nThe words were barely uttered, when he encountered a savage of gigantic\\nstature, and of the fiercest mien. At the same moment, Duncan found\\nhimself engaged with the other, in a similar contest of hand to hand.\\nWith ready skill, Hawkeye and his antagonist each grasped that uplifted\\narm of the other which held the dangerous knife. For near a minute they\\nstood looking one another in the eye, and gradually exerting the power\\nof their muscles for the mastery. At length, the toughened sinews of the\\nwhite man prevailed over the less practised limbs of the native. The arm\\nof the latter slowly gave way before the increasing force of the scout,\\nwho suddenly wresting his armed hand from the grasp of the foe, drove\\nthe sharp weapon through his naked bosom to the heart. In the meantime\\nHeyward had been pressed in a more deadly struggle. His slight sword was\\nsnapped in the first encounter. As he was destitute of any other means\\nof defence, his safety now depended entirely on bodily strength and\\nresolution. Though deficient in neither of these qualities, he had met\\nan enemy every way his equal. Happily, he soon succeeded in disarming\\nhis adversary, whose knife fell on the rock at their feet; and from this\\nmoment it became a fierce struggle, who should cast the other over the\\ndizzy height into a neighboring cavern of the falls. Every successive\\nstruggle brought them nearer to the verge, where Duncan perceived the\\nfinal and conquering effort must be made. Each of the combatants threw\\nall his energies into that effort, and the result was, that both\\ntottered on the brink of the precipice. Heyward felt the grasp of the\\nother at his throat, and saw the grim smile the savage gave, under the\\nrevengeful hope that he hurried his enemy to a fate similar to his own,\\nas he felt his body slowly yielding to a resistless power, and the young\\nman experienced the passing agony of such a moment in all its horrors.\\nAt that instant of extreme danger, a dark hand and glancing knife\\nappeared before him; the Indian released his hold, as the blood flowed\\nfreely from around the several tendons of the wrist; and while Duncan\\nwas drawn backward by the saving arm of Uncas, his charmed eyes were\\nstill riveted on the fierce and disappointed countenance of his foe, who\\nfell sullenly and disappointed down the irrecoverable precipice.\\n\\n\"To cover! to cover!\" cried Hawkeye, who just then had despatched the\\nenemy; \"to cover, for your lives! the work is but half ended!\"\\n\\nThe young Mohican gave a shout of triumph, and, followed by Duncan, he\\nglided up the acclivity they had descended to the combat, and sought the\\nfriendly shelter of the rocks and shrubs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      \"They linger yet,\\n  Avengers of their native land.\"\\n\\n  GRAY.\\n\\n\\nThe warning call of the scout was not uttered without occasion. During\\nthe occurrence of the deadly encounter just related, the roar of the\\nfalls was unbroken by any human sound whatever. It would seem that\\ninterest in the result had kept the natives on the opposite shores in\\nbreathless suspense, while the quick evolutions and swift changes in the\\nposition of the combatants, effectually prevented a fire that might\\nprove dangerous alike to friend and enemy. But the moment the struggle\\nwas decided, a yell arose as fierce and savage as wild and revengful\\npassions could throw into the air. It was followed by the swift flashes\\nof the rifles, which sent their leaden messengers across the rock in\\nvolleys, as though the assailants would pour out their impotent fury on\\nthe insensible scene of the fatal contest.\\n\\nA steady, though deliberate return was made from the rifle of\\nChingachgook, who had maintained his post throughout the fray with\\nunmoved resolution. When the triumphant shout of Uncas was borne to his\\nears, the gratified father raised his voice in a single responsive cry,\\nafter which his busy piece alone proved that he still guarded his pass\\nwith unwearied diligence. In this manner many minutes flew by with the\\nswiftness of thought: the rifles of the assailants speaking, at times,\\nin rattling volleys, and at others, in occasional, scattering shots.\\nThough the rock, the trees, and the shrubs, were cut and torn in a\\nhundred places around the besieged, their cover was so close, and so\\nrigidly maintained, that, as yet, David had been the only sufferer in\\ntheir little band.\\n\\n\"Let them burn their powder,\" said the deliberate scout, while bullet\\nafter bullet whizzed by the place where he securely lay; \"there will be\\na fine gathering of lead when it is over, and I fancy the imps will tire\\nof the sport, afore these old stones cry out for mercy! Uncas, boy, you\\nwaste the kernels by overcharging: and a kicking rifle never carries a\\ntrue bullet. I told you to take that loping miscreant under the line of\\nwhite paint; now, if your bullet went a hair\\'s breadth, it went two\\ninches above it. The life lies low in a Mingo, and humanity teaches us\\nto make a quick end of the sarpents.\"\\n\\nA quiet smile lighted the haughty features of the young Mohican,\\nbetraying his knowledge of the English language, as well as of the\\nother\\'s meaning; but he suffered it to pass away without vindication or\\nreply.\\n\\n\"I cannot permit you to accuse Uncas of want of judgment or of skill,\"\\nsaid Duncan; \"he saved my life in the coolest and readiest manner, and\\nhe has made a friend who never will require to be reminded of the debt\\nhe owes.\"\\n\\nUncas partly raised his body, and offered his hand to the grasp of\\nHeyward. During this act of friendship, the two young men exchanged\\nlooks of intelligence which caused Duncan to forget the character and\\ncondition of his wild associate. In the meanwhile, Hawkeye, who looked\\non this burst of youthful feeling with a cool but kind regard, made the\\nfollowing reply:--\\n\\n\"Life is an obligation which friends often owe each other in the\\nwilderness. I dare say I may have served Uncas some such turn myself\\nbefore now; and I very well remember that he has stood between me and\\ndeath five different times: three times from the Mingos, once in\\ncrossing Horican, and--\"\\n\\n\"That bullet was better aimed than common!\" exclaimed Duncan,\\ninvoluntarily shrinking from a shot which struck the rock at his side\\nwith a smart rebound.\\n\\nHawkeye laid his hand on the shapeless metal, and shook his head, as he\\nexamined it, saying, \"Falling lead is never flattened! had it come from\\nthe clouds this might have happened!\"\\n\\nBut the rifle of Uncas was deliberately raised towards the heavens,\\ndirecting his companions to a point, where the mystery was immediately\\nexplained. A ragged oak grew on the right bank of the river, nearly\\nopposite to their position, which, seeking the freedom of the open\\nspace, had inclined so far forward, that its upper branches overhung\\nthat arm of the stream which flowed nearest to its own shore. Among the\\ntopmost leaves, which scantily concealed the gnarled and stunted limbs,\\na savage was nestled, partly concealed by the trunk of the tree, and\\npartly exposed, as though looking down upon them to ascertain the effect\\nproduced by his treacherous aim.\\n\\n\"These devils will scale heaven to circumvent us to our ruin,\" said\\nHawkeye; \"keep him in play, boy, until I can bring \\'Killdeer\\' to bear,\\nwhen we will try his metal on each side of the tree at once.\"\\n\\nUncas delayed his fire until the scout uttered the word. The rifles\\nflashed, the leaves and the bark of the oak flew into the air, and were\\nscattered by the wind, but the Indian answered their assault by a\\ntaunting laugh, sending down upon them another bullet in return, that\\nstruck the cap of Hawkeye from his head. Once more the savage yells\\nburst out of the woods, and the leaden hail whistled above the heads of\\nthe besieged, as if to confine them to a place where they might become\\neasy victims to the enterprise of the warrior who had mounted the tree.\\n\\n\"This must be looked to!\" said the scout, glancing about him with an\\nanxious eye. \"Uncas, call up your father; we have need of all our\\nwe\\'pons to bring the cunning varmint from his roost.\"\\n\\nThe signal was instantly given; and, before Hawkeye had reloaded his\\nrifle, they were joined by Chingachgook. When his son pointed out to the\\nexperienced warrior the situation of their dangerous enemy, the usual\\nexclamatory \"Hugh!\" burst from his lips; after which, no further\\nexpression of surprise or alarm was suffered to escape him. Hawkeye and\\nthe Mohicans conversed earnestly together in Delaware for a few moments,\\nwhen each quietly took his post, in order to execute the plan they had\\nspeedily devised.\\n\\nThe warrior in the oak had maintained a quick, though ineffectual fire,\\nfrom the moment of his discovery. But his aim was interrupted by the\\nvigilance of his enemies, whose rifles instantaneously bore on any part\\nof his person that was left exposed. Still his bullets fell in the\\ncentre of the crouching party. The clothes of Heyward, which rendered\\nhim peculiarly conspicuous, were repeatedly cut, and once blood was\\ndrawn from a slight wound in his arm.\\n\\nAt length, emboldened by the long and patient watchfulness of his\\nenemies, the Huron attempted a better and more fatal aim. The quick eye\\nof the Mohicans caught the dark line of his lower limbs incautiously\\nexposed through the thin foliage, a few inches from the trunk of the\\ntree. Their rifles made a common report, when, sinking on his wounded\\nlimb, part of the body of the savage came into view. Swift as thought,\\nHawkeye seized the advantage and discharged his fatal weapon into the\\ntop of the oak. The leaves were unusually agitated; the dangerous rifle\\nfell from its commanding elevation, and after a few moments of vain\\nstruggling, the form of the savage was seen swinging in the wind, while\\nhe still grasped a ragged and naked branch of the tree, with hands\\nclenched in desperation.\\n\\n\"Give him, in pity give him--the contents of another rifle!\" cried\\nDuncan, turning away his eyes in horror from the spectacle of a\\nfellow-creature in such awful jeopardy.\\n\\n\"Not a karnel!\" exclaimed the obdurate Hawkeye; \"his death is certain,\\nand we have no powder to spare, for Indian fights sometimes last for\\ndays; \\'tis their scalps or ours!--and God, who made us, has put into our\\nnatures the craving to keep the skin on the head!\"\\n\\nAgainst this stern and unyielding morality, supported as it was by such\\nvisible policy, there was no appeal. From that moment the yells in the\\nforest once more ceased, the fire was suffered to decline, and all eyes,\\nthose of friends as well as enemies, became fixed on the hopeless\\ncondition of the wretch who was dangling between heaven and earth. The\\nbody yielded to the currents of air, and though no murmur or groan\\nescaped the victim, there were instants when he grimly faced his foes,\\nand the anguish of cold despair might be traced, through the intervening\\ndistance, in possession of his swarthy lineaments. Three several times\\nthe scout raised his piece in mercy, and as often prudence getting the\\nbetter of his intention, it was again silently lowered. At length one\\nhand of the Huron lost its hold, and dropped exhausted to his side. A\\ndesperate and fruitless struggle to recover the branch succeeded, and\\nthen the savage was seen for a fleeting instant, grasping wildly at the\\nempty air. The lightning is not quicker than was the flame from the\\nrifle of Hawkeye; the limbs of the victim trembled and contracted, the\\nhead fell to the bosom, and the body parted the foaming waters like\\nlead, when the element closed above it, in its ceaseless velocity, and\\nevery vestige of the unhappy Huron was lost forever.\\n\\nNo shout of triumph succeeded this important advantage, but even the\\nMohicans gazed at each other in silent horror. A single yell burst from\\nthe woods, and all was again still. Hawkeye, who alone appeared to\\nreason on the occasion, shook his head at his own momentary weakness,\\neven uttering his self-disapprobation aloud.\\n\\n\"\\'Twas the last charge in my horn, and the last bullet in my pouch, and\\n\\'twas the act of a boy!\" he said; \"what mattered it whether he struck\\nthe rock living or dead: feeling would soon be over. Uncas, lad, go down\\nto the canoe, and bring up the big horn; it is all the powder we have\\nleft, and we shall need it to the last grain, or I am ignorant of the\\nMingo nature.\"\\n\\nThe young Mohican complied, leaving the scout turning over the useless\\ncontents of his pouch, and shaking the empty horn with renewed\\ndiscontent. From this unsatisfactory examination, however, he was soon\\ncalled by a loud and piercing exclamation from Uncas, that sounded, even\\nto the unpractised ears of Duncan, as the signal of some new and\\nunexpected calamity. Every thought filled with apprehension for the\\nprecious treasure he had concealed in the cavern, the young man started\\nto his feet, totally regardless of the hazard he incurred by such an\\nexposure. As if actuated by a common impulse, his movement was imitated\\nby his companions, and, together, they rushed down the pass to the\\nfriendly chasm, with a rapidity that rendered the scattering fire of\\ntheir enemies perfectly harmless. The unwonted cry had brought the\\nsisters, together with the wounded David, from their place of refuge;\\nand the whole party, at a single glance, was made acquainted with the\\nnature of the disaster that had disturbed even the practised stoicism of\\ntheir youthful Indian protector.\\n\\nAt a short distance from the rock, their little bark was to be seen\\nfloating across the eddy, towards the swift current of the river, in a\\nmanner which proved that its course was directed by some hidden agent.\\nThe instant this unwelcome sight caught the eye of the scout, his rifle\\nwas levelled as by instinct, but the barrel gave no answer to the bright\\nsparks of the flint.\\n\\n\"\\'Tis too late, \\'tis too late!\" Hawkeye exclaimed, dropping the useless\\npiece in bitter disappointment; \"the miscreant has struck the rapid; and\\nhad we powder, it could hardly send the lead swifter than he now goes!\"\\n\\nThe adventurous Huron raised his head above the shelter of the canoe,\\nand while it glided swiftly down the stream, he waved his hand, and gave\\nforth the shout, which was the known signal of success. His cry was\\nanswered by a yell and a laugh from the woods, as tauntingly exulting as\\nif fifty demons were uttering their blasphemies at the fall of some\\nChristian soul.\\n\\n\"Well may you laugh, ye children of the devil!\" said the scout, seating\\nhimself on a projection of the rock, and suffering his gun to fall\\nneglected at his feet, \"for the three quickest and surest rifles in\\nthese woods are no better than so many stalks of mullein, or the last\\nyear\\'s horns of a buck!\"\\n\\n\"What is to be done?\" demanded Duncan, losing the first feeling of\\ndisappointment in a more manly desire for exertion; \"what will become of\\nus?\"\\n\\nHawkeye made no other reply than by passing his finger around the crown\\nof his head, in a manner so significant, that none who witnessed the\\naction could mistake its meaning.\\n\\n\"Surely, surely, our case is not so desperate!\" exclaimed the youth;\\n\"the Hurons are not here; we may make good the caverns; we may oppose\\ntheir landing.\"\\n\\n\"With what?\" coolly demanded the scout. \"The arrows of Uncas, or such\\ntears as women shed! No, no; you are young, and rich, and have friends,\\nand at such an age I know it is hard to die! But,\" glancing his eyes at\\nthe Mohicans, \"let us remember we are men without a cross, and let us\\nteach these natives of the forest that white blood can run as freely as\\nred, when the appointed hour is come.\"\\n\\nDuncan turned quickly in the direction indicated by the other\\'s eyes,\\nand read a confirmation of his worst apprehensions in the conduct of the\\nIndians. Chingachgook, placing himself in a dignified posture on another\\nfragment of the rock, had already laid aside his knife and tomahawk, and\\nwas in the act of taking the eagle\\'s plume from his head, and smoothing\\nthe solitary tuft of hair in readiness to perform its last and revolting\\noffice. His countenance was composed, though thoughtful, while his dark\\ngleaming eyes were gradually losing the fierceness of the combat in an\\nexpression better suited to the change he expected momentarily to\\nundergo.\\n\\n\"Our case is not, cannot be so hopeless!\" said Duncan; \"even at this\\nmoment succor may be at hand. I see no enemies! they have sickened of a\\nstruggle in which they risk so much with so little prospect of gain!\"\\n\\n\"It may be a minute, or it may be an hour, afore the wily sarpents steal\\nupon us, and it is quite in natur\\' for them to be lying within hearing\\nat this very moment,\" said Hawkeye; \"but come they will, and in such a\\nfashion as will leave us nothing to hope! Chingachgook\"--he spoke in\\nDelaware--\"my brother, we have fought our last battle together, and the\\nMaquas will triumph in the death of the sage man of the Mohicans, and of\\nthe pale-face, whose eyes can make night as day, and level the clouds\\nto the mists of the springs!\"\\n\\n\"Let the Mingo women go weep over their slain!\" returned the Indian,\\nwith characteristic pride and unmoved firmness; \"the Great Snake of the\\nMohicans has coiled himself in their wigwams, and has poisoned their\\ntriumph with the wailings of children whose fathers have not returned!\\nEleven warriors lie hid from the graves of their tribes since the snows\\nhave melted, and none will tell where to find them when the tongue of\\nChingachgook shall be silent! Let them draw the sharpest knife, and\\nwhirl the swiftest tomahawk, for their bitterest enemy is in their\\nhands. Uncas, topmost branch of a noble trunk, call on the cowards to\\nhasten or their hearts will soften, and they will change to women!\"\\n\\n\"They look among the fishes for their dead!\" returned the low, soft\\nvoice of the youthful chieftain; \"the Hurons float with the slimy eels!\\nThey drop from the oaks like fruit that is ready to be eaten! and the\\nDelawares laugh!\"\\n\\n\"Ay, ay,\" muttered the scout, who had listened to this peculiar burst of\\nthe natives with deep attention; \"they have warmed their Indian\\nfeelings, and they\\'ll soon provoke the Maquas to give them a speedy end.\\nAs for me, who am of the whole blood of the whites, it is befitting that\\nI should die as becomes my color, with no words of scoffing in my mouth,\\nand without bitterness at the heart!\"\\n\\n\"Why die at all!\" said Cora, advancing from the place where natural\\nhorror had, until this moment, held her riveted to the rock; \"the path\\nis open on every side; fly, then, to the woods, and call on God for\\nsuccor. Go, brave men, we owe you too much already; let us no longer\\ninvolve you in our hapless fortunes!\"\\n\\n\"You but little know the craft of the Iroquois, lady, if you judge they\\nhave left the path open to the woods!\" returned Hawkeye, who, however,\\nimmediately added in his simplicity, \"the down stream current, it is\\ncertain, might soon sweep us beyond the reach of their rifles or the\\nsounds of their voices.\"\\n\\n\"Then try the river. Why linger to add to the number of the victims of\\nour merciless enemies?\"\\n\\n\"Why,\" repeated the scout, looking about him proudly, \"because it is\\nbetter for a man to die at peace with himself than to live haunted by an\\nevil conscience! What answer could we give Munro, when he asked us where\\nand how we left his children?\"\\n\\n\"Go to him, and say, that you left them with a message to hasten to\\ntheir aid,\" returned Cora, advancing nigher to the scout, in her\\ngenerous ardor; \"that the Hurons bear them into the northern wilds, but\\nthat by vigilance and speed they may yet be rescued; and if, after all,\\nit should please heaven that his assistance come too late, bear to him,\"\\nshe continued, her voice gradually lowering, until it seemed nearly\\nchoked, \"the love, the blessings, the final prayers of his daughters,\\nand bid him not mourn their early fate, but to look forward with humble\\nconfidence to the Christian\\'s goal to meet his children.\"\\n\\nThe hard, weather-beaten features of the scout began to work, and when\\nshe had ended, he dropped his chin to his hand, like a man musing\\nprofoundly on the nature of the proposal.\\n\\n\"There is reason in her words!\" at length broke from his compressed and\\ntrembling lips; \"ay, and they bear the spirit of Christianity; what\\nmight be right and proper in a redskin, may be sinful in a man who has\\nnot even a cross in blood to plead for his ignorance. Chingachgook!\\nUncas! hear you the talk of the dark-eyed woman!\"\\n\\nHe now spoke in Delaware to his companions, and his address, though calm\\nand deliberate, seemed very decided. The elder Mohican heard him with\\ndeep gravity, and appeared to ponder on his words, as though he felt the\\nimportance of their import. After a moment of hesitation, he waved his\\nhand in assent, and uttered the English word \"Good!\" with the peculiar\\nemphasis of his people. Then, replacing his knife and tomahawk in his\\ngirdle, the warrior moved silently to the edge of the rock which was\\nmost concealed from the banks of the river. Here he paused a moment,\\npointed significantly to the woods below, and saying a few words in his\\nown language, as if indicating his intended route, he dropped into the\\nwater, and sank from before the eyes of the witnesses of his movements.\\n\\nThe scout delayed his departure to speak to the generous girl, whose\\nbreathing became lighter as she saw the success of her remonstrance.\\n\\n\"Wisdom is sometimes given to the young, as well as to the old,\" he\\nsaid; \"and what you have spoken is wise, not to call it by a better\\nword. If you are led into the woods, that is such of you as may be\\nspared for a while, break the twigs on the bushes as you pass, and make\\nthe marks of your trail as broad as you can, when, if mortal eyes can\\nsee them, depend on having a friend who will follow to the ends of \\'arth\\nafore he desarts you.\"\\n\\nHe gave Cora an affectionate shake of the hand, lifted his rifle, and\\nafter regarding it a moment with melancholy solicitude, laid it\\ncarefully aside, and descended to the place where Chingachgook had just\\ndisappeared. For an instant he hung suspended by the rock; and looking\\nabout him, with a countenance of peculiar care, he added, bitterly, \"Had\\nthe powder held out, this disgrace could never have befallen!\" then,\\nloosening his hold, the water closed above his head, and he also became\\nlost to view.\\n\\nAll eyes were now turned on Uncas, who stood leaning against the ragged\\nrock, in immovable composure. After waiting a short time, Cora pointed\\ndown the river, and said:--\\n\\n\"Your friends have not been seen, and are now, most probably, in safety;\\nis it not time for you to follow?\"\\n\\n\"Uncas will stay,\" the young Mohican calmly answered in English.\\n\\n\"To increase the horror of our capture, and to diminish the chances of\\nour release! Go, generous young man,\" Cora continued, lowering her eyes\\nunder the gaze of the Mohican, and, perhaps, with an intuitive\\nconsciousness of her power; \"go to my father, as I have said, and be the\\nmost confidential of my messengers. Tell him to trust you with the means\\nto buy the freedom of his daughters. Go! \\'tis my wish, \\'tis my prayer,\\nthat you will go!\"\\n\\nThe settled, calm look of the young chief changed to an expression of\\ngloom, but he no longer hesitated. With a noiseless step he crossed the\\nrock, and dropped into the troubled stream. Hardly a breath was drawn by\\nthose he left behind, until they caught a glimpse of his head emerging\\nfor air, far down the current, when he again sank, and was seen no more.\\n\\nThese sudden and apparently successful experiments had all taken place\\nin a few minutes of that time which had now become so precious. After\\nthe last look at Uncas, Cora turned, and, with a quivering lip,\\naddressed herself to Heyward:--\\n\\n\"I have heard of your boasted skill in the water, too, Duncan,\" she\\nsaid; \"follow, then, the wise example set you by these simple and\\nfaithful beings.\"\\n\\n\"Is such the faith that Cora Munro would exact from her protector?\" said\\nthe young man, smiling mournfully, but with bitterness.\\n\\n\"This is not a time for idle subtleties and false opinions,\" she\\nanswered; \"but a moment when every duty should be equally considered.\\nTo us you can be of no further service here, but your precious life may\\nbe saved for other and nearer friends.\"\\n\\nHe made no reply, though his eyes fell wistfully on the beautiful form\\nof Alice, who was clinging to his arm with the dependency of an infant.\\n\\n\"Consider,\" continued Cora, after a pause, during which she seemed to\\nstruggle with a pang even more acute than any that her fears had\\nexcited, \"that the worst to us can be but death; a tribute that all must\\npay at the good time of God\\'s appointment.\"\\n\\n\"There are evils worse than death,\" said Duncan, speaking hoarsely, and\\nas if fretful at her importunity, \"but which the presence of one who\\nwould die in your behalf may avert.\"\\n\\nCora ceased her entreaties; and, veiling her face in her shawl, drew the\\nnearly insensible Alice after her into the deepest recess of the inner\\ncavern.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "    'summary_text': 'Feeling that the cry is some kind of warning, whether intended or not, Hawkeye leads the entire party from the caves. As Heyward remarks upon the loveliness of the scene, the horrifying sound comes again as if from the bed of the river, and Heyward now recognizes it as the shriek of a horse in terror. The scout\\'s reckoning that the horses are frightened by hovering wolves is immediately confirmed by a long howl that swiftly recedes into the depths of the forest, an abandonment that indicates enemy Indians are near. Once again secure in his knowledge of things, Hawkeye directs everyone to hide in moon shadows where they have a full view of both shores. Hours pass, and all fall asleep except the ever watchful scout and the Mohicans. The moon sets, and as pale dawn begins, the Iroquois attack with hellish yells and rifle reports. Gamut exposes himself, is wounded, and falls unconscious, while Hawkeye slips below and shoots one enemy, afterwards saying that their only hope is to hold the rock until Munro sends a party to help them. Heyward takes the girls into the outer cave where the reviving Gamut has been taken. As Cora reminds him how much his safety means to them, the major glances at Alice, reassures them, and rejoins the others outside. He and the scout deploy themselves in a little thicket of pines below the rock that splits the falls. Dawn comes. Then a long, anxious, and quiet watch succeeds until Hawkeye detects that four Indians have swum dangerously down to the rock above the defenders. As they wait, a fifth one, struggling to reach the rock, is thrown into the air and over the falls with a single, despairing shriek. After whistling Uncas to them, Hawkeye and the warrior shoot two Indians as the four charge them. When Heyward\\'s pistols misfire, he and the scout grapple hand-to-hand with the two remaining enemies until Hawkeye dispatches his foe with a knife. Heyward is about to be dragged over the precipice with the other when Uncas severs the tendons of the Iroquois\\' wrist and grabs Heyward as the wounded savage falls to his destruction. As the survivors take cover, the Indians on shore yell and fire, and a give-and-take battle begins. One Iroquois, who has climbed an oak tree near shore, fires down upon the protagonists and slightly wounds Heyward. Setting up a crossfire with Chingachgook, Hawkeye fires his rifle \"Killdeer\" and wounds the savage, who is left swinging in the wind with a desperate grasp on a branch. To save powder, the scout refuses to show mercy and finish the kill, but he weakens and discharges his last powder and bullet as the man falls toward the rocks and water. Uncas goes for munitions in the canoe only to find an Indian swimming away with it. Now essentially bereft of defensive means, the Mohicans scoff at their enemies and prepare for death. Hawkeye is quietly and stoically preparing himself also when Cora, who has been brave all along, entreats the men to escape downstream and effect a rescue. Convinced of her reason, Chingachgook slips under the water and away. After telling her to leave a marked trail if they are captured, Hawkeye carefully lays \"Killdeer\" aside and disappears into the water. Uncas remains until Cora, lowering her eyes, asks him to go to her father as her \"most confidential\" messenger; then he also drops into the water. When Heyward refuses to leave on the grounds that his presence may keep the girls from evils worse than death, Cora draws \"the nearly insensible Alice after her into the deepest recess of the inner cavern.\"',\n",
       "    'summary_analysis': 'While outwardly these two chapters are concerned chiefly with fright and action for entertaining the reader and multiplying difficulties for the characters, it also portrays the bloody cross-purposes of frontier strife: seven Iroquois are killed and two white men are wounded, while the male protagonists are finally confronted with a moral dilemma. Are they to face danger and probable death with calm, frontal bravery, or are they to turn to subterfuge and escape, hoping to effect a rescue but running the risk of being deserters? It is a bigger problem than that found in most sentimental novels, where woman\\'s greatest threat is usually to her virtue or reputation. Here it involves the age-old physical responsibility of the male for the female and -- greater yet -- of the strong for the weak, the typical assumption in the myth of the American frontiersman. The decision and resultant escape of Hawkeye, whose Christian reasoning is notably different from that of the Mohicans, is of a piece with the American self-ideal about necessity and the ingenuity of \"finding a way out.\" The fortitude of Cora at this point is also consistent with the accredited strength of American pioneer womanhood; it is she who sees beyond the immediate grave situation to a possible desperate solution for which she femininely entreats rather than insists. Further, though Cooper\\'s females only seldom do so, in this instance Cora takes on the three-dimensional qualities of a real woman character when, revealing a bit of her personal feelings and utilizing Uncas\\', she urges the subtle distinction about messengers which leads the young Mohican to escape also. At his best, Cooper is not a novelist who presses his thematic elements very hard upon his reader. But the preceding elements are in these two chapters, and so are others such as the rifle lore that Hawkeye voices during the battles. The two white men from Fort Edward are significantly wounded in this raw frontier condition that is new to them. Although as yet unaware of it, Gamut is already confronting what Hawkeye knows and, after the psalmodist is unconscious, voices: that \"singing won\\'t do any good with the Iroquois.\" Thus in the singing master, religious idealism and reality are meeting head-on. Also, Cooper is very slowly and carefully developing the attraction between Uncas and Cora. The surplus sentimental heroine is gradually being paired with a hero, but it is an original pairing that involves the conservative idea of racial \"place\" and is to result in tragic complications. While the story moves along at a brisk pace with action and Indian customs such as the preparation for dying, Cooper is touching upon and getting ready to develop further more crucial aspects of the frontier situation in the New World.',\n",

Nonetheless, they all hide in the cave, Gamut still addled and Alice trembling and weeping against Cora\\'s breast. The major closes the inner entrance with the blanket and a pile of sassafras, then seats himself with a pistol clenched convulsively in his hand. Gamut sings \\\\\"Isle of Wight,\\\\\" which is interrupted by savage yells from the center of the island as a rush of voices pours down the island. When a triumphant cry is followed by the shout, \\\\\"La Longue Carabine!\\\\\" Heyward for the first time realizes that his late companion was the celebrated hunter and scout of the English camp, and he feels certain that their friends have escaped. As the Indians enter the neighboring cavern, the major peers out of his sassafras entrance, sees the gigantic chief, and watches as exultant warriors bring blood-stained brush from the other cave and unwittingly pile it against his entrance. Though the Indians\\' shouts indicate anger in seeing their own dead and disappointment at finding no prisoners or dead enemies, Heyward feels that perhaps now they are safe. However, just as Alice begins to offer thanks, the features of Le Renard Subtil appear at the other entrance and the major fires his pistol without success. There is only a moment of surprise before a clamorous rush captures the four whites, who are dragged outside and surrounded by the triumphant Hurons.\", \"analysis\": \"With the woodsmen off the scene of action, this chapter presents the relative ineffectiveness of the \\\\\"outsiders.\\\\\" As before, Alice is the sentimental heroine, trembling and ready to swoon so that she demands the attention of others. Gamut is still too much under the influence of his wound to learn anything from his situation yet; he mechanically follows his interest in song. It is notable that while Cooper continues to present him as a weak personage -- a weakness consistent with his naivete as a comic Yankee character -- he again credits the psalmodist with a singing voice so good that it can cast a spell even through a travesty of song. Heyward, still solicitous of the girls and especially of Alice, is seen as the determined but unsuccessful hero who is too much out of his element. Little is seen of Cora in the present action, but she remains a strong character in contrast to Alice. By the end of this chapter, the first segment of the plot pattern that Cooper works so well is completed: the pursuit, which was instigated earlier, has now reached the point of capture. What the reader can expect now are the possibility and difficulty of escape. Actually Cooper has already varied his pattern by letting three of the party escape before the capture. Plot thus adds hopeful suspense to the brutal threat of the obviously savage captors, made more threatening by the presence of the subtle Magua.\"}',\n",
       "    'chapter': '\\n                            \"Be gay securely;\\n  Dispel, my fair, with smiles, the tim\\'rous clouds,\\n  That hang on thy clear brow.\"\\n\\n  _Death of Agrippina._\\n\\n\\nThe sudden and almost magical change, from the stirring incidents of the\\ncombat to the stillness that now reigned around him, acted on the heated\\nimagination of Heyward like some exciting dream. While all the images\\nand events he had witnessed remained deeply impressed on his memory, he\\nfelt a difficulty in persuading himself of their truth. Still ignorant\\nof the fate of those who had trusted to the aid of the swift current, he\\nat first listened intently to any signal, or sounds of alarm, which\\nmight announce the good or evil fortune of their hazardous undertaking.\\nHis attention was, however, bestowed in vain; for, with the\\ndisappearance of Uncas, every sign of the adventurers had been lost,\\nleaving him in total uncertainty of their fate.\\n\\nIn a moment of such painful doubt, Duncan did not hesitate to look about\\nhim, without consulting that protection from the rocks which just before\\nhad been so necessary to his safety. Every effort, however, to detect\\nthe least evidence of the approach of their hidden enemies, was as\\nfruitless as the inquiry after his late companions. The wooded banks of\\nthe rivers seemed again deserted by everything possessing animal life.\\nThe uproar which had so lately echoed through the vaults of the forest\\nwas gone, leaving the rush of the waters to swell and sink on the\\ncurrents of the air, in the unmingled sweetness of nature. A fish-hawk,\\nwhich, secure on the topmost branches of a dead pine, had been a distant\\nspectator of the fray, now stooped from his high and ragged perch, and\\nsoared, in wide sweeps, above his prey; while a jay, whose noisy voice\\nhad been stilled by the hoarser cries of the savages, ventured again to\\nopen his discordant throat, as though once more in undisturbed\\npossession of his wild domains. Duncan caught from these natural\\naccompaniments of the solitary scene a glimmering of hope; and he began\\nto rally his faculties to renewed exertions, with something like a\\nreviving confidence of success.\\n\\n\"The Hurons are not to be seen,\" he said, addressing David, who had by\\nno means recovered from the effects of the stunning blow he had\\nreceived; \"let us conceal ourselves in the cavern, and trust the rest to\\nProvidence.\"\\n\\n\"I remember to have united with two comely maidens, in lifting up our\\nvoices in praise and thanksgiving,\" returned the bewildered\\nsinging-master; \"since which time I have been visited by a heavy\\njudgment for my sins. I have been mocked with the likeness of sleep,\\nwhile sounds of discord have rent my ears, such as might manifest the\\nfulness of time, and that nature had forgotten her harmony.\"\\n\\n\"Poor fellow! thine own period was, in truth, near its accomplishment!\\nBut arouse, and come with me; I will lead you where all other sounds but\\nthose of your own psalmody shall be excluded.\"\\n\\n\"There is melody in the fall of the cataract, and the rushing of many\\nwaters is sweet to the senses!\" said David, pressing his hand confusedly\\non his brow. \"Is not the air yet filled with shrieks and cries, as\\nthough the departed spirits of the damned--\"\\n\\n\"Not now, not now,\" interrupted the impatient Heyward, \"they have\\nceased, and they who raised them, I trust in God, they are gone too!\\neverything but the water is still and at peace; in, then, where you may\\ncreate those sounds you love so well to hear.\"\\n\\nDavid smiled sadly, though not without a momentary gleam of pleasure, at\\nthis allusion to his beloved vocation. He no longer hesitated to be led\\nto a spot which promised such unalloyed gratification to his wearied\\nsenses; and, leaning on the arm of his companion, he entered the narrow\\nmouth of the cave. Duncan seized a pile of the sassafras, which he drew\\nbefore the passage, studiously concealing every appearance of an\\naperture. Within this fragile barrier he arranged the blankets abandoned\\nby the foresters, darkening the inner extremity of the cavern, while its\\nouter received a chastened light from the narrow ravine, through which\\none arm of the river rushed, to form the junction with its sister\\nbranch, a few rods below.\\n\\n\"I like not that principle of the natives, which teaches them to submit\\nwithout a struggle, in emergencies that appear desperate,\" he said,\\nwhile busied in this employment; \"our own maxim, which says, \\'while life\\nremains there is hope,\\' is more consoling, and better suited to a\\nsoldier\\'s temperament. To you, Cora, I will urge no words of idle\\nencouragement; your own fortitude and undisturbed reason will teach you\\nall that may become your sex; but cannot we dry the tears of that\\ntrembling weeper on your bosom?\"\\n\\n\"I am calmer, Duncan,\" said Alice, raising herself from the arms of her\\nsister, and forcing an appearance of composure through her tears; \"much\\ncalmer, now. Surely, in this hidden spot we are safe, we are secret,\\nfree from injury; we will hope everything from those generous men who\\nhave risked so much already in our behalf.\"\\n\\n\"Now does our gentle Alice speak like a daughter of Munro!\" said\\nHeyward, pausing to press her hand as he passed towards the outer\\nentrance of the cavern. \"With two such examples of courage before him, a\\nman would be ashamed to prove other than a hero.\" He then seated himself\\nin the centre of the cavern, grasping his remaining pistol with a hand\\nconvulsively clenched, while his contracted and frowning eye announced\\nthe sullen desperation of his purpose. \"The Hurons, if they come, may\\nnot gain our position so easily as they think,\" he lowly muttered; and\\ndropping his head back against the rock, he seemed to await the result\\nin patience, though his gaze was unceasingly bent on the open avenue to\\ntheir place of retreat.\\n\\nWith the last sound of his voice, a deep, a long, and almost breathless\\nsilence succeeded. The fresh air of the morning had penetrated the\\nrecess, and its influence was gradually felt on the spirits of its\\ninmates. As minute after minute passed by, leaving them in undisturbed\\nsecurity, the insinuating feeling of hope was gradually gaining\\npossession of every bosom, though each one felt reluctant to give\\nutterance to expectations that the next moment might so fearfully\\ndestroy.\\n\\nDavid alone formed an exception to these varying emotions. A gleam of\\nlight from the opening crossed his wan countenance, and fell upon the\\npages of the little volume, whose leaves he was again occupied in\\nturning, as if searching for some song more fitted to their condition\\nthan any that had yet met his eye. He was, most probably, acting all\\nthis time under a confused recollection of the promised consolation of\\nDuncan. At length, it would seem, his patient industry found its reward;\\nfor, without explanation or apology, he pronounced aloud the words \"Isle\\nof Wight,\" drew a long, sweet sound from his pitch-pipe, and then ran\\nthrough the preliminary modulations of the air, whose name he had just\\nmentioned with the sweeter tones of his own musical voice.\\n\\n\"May not this prove dangerous?\" asked Cora, glancing her dark eye at\\nMajor Heyward.\\n\\n\"Poor fellow! his voice is too feeble to be heard amid the din of the\\nfalls,\" was the answer; \"besides, the cavern will prove his friend. Let\\nhim indulge his passion, since it may be done without hazard.\"\\n\\n\"Isle of Wight!\" repeated David, looking about him with that dignity\\nwith which he had long been wont to silence the whispering echoes of his\\nschool; \"\\'tis a brave tune, and set to solemn words; let it be sung with\\nmeet respect!\"\\n\\nAfter allowing a moment of stillness, to enforce his discipline, the\\nvoice of the singer was heard, in low, murmuring syllables, gradually\\nstealing on the ear, until it filled the narrow vault with sounds\\nrendered trebly thrilling by the feeble and tremulous utterance produced\\nby his debility. The melody, which no weakness could destroy, gradually\\nwrought its sweet influence on the senses of those who heard it. It even\\nprevailed over the miserable travesty of the song of David which the\\nsinger had selected from a volume of similar effusions, and caused the\\nsense to be forgotten in the insinuating harmony of the sounds. Alice\\nunconsciously dried her tears, and bent her melting eyes on the pallid\\nfeatures of Gamut with an expression of chastened delight that she\\nneither affected nor wished to conceal. Cora bestowed an approving smile\\non the pious efforts of the namesake of the Jewish prince, and Heyward\\nsoon turned his steady, stern look from the outlet of the cavern, to\\nfasten it, with a milder character, on the face of David, or to meet the\\nwandering beams which at moments strayed from the humid eyes of Alice.\\nThe open sympathy of the listeners stirred the spirit of the votary of\\nmusic, whose voice regained its richness and volume, without losing that\\ntouching softness which proved its secret charm. Exerting his renovated\\npowers to their utmost, he was yet filling the arches of the cave with\\nlong and full tones, when a yell burst into the air without, that\\ninstantly stilled his pious strains, choking his voice suddenly, as\\nthough his heart had literally bounded into the passage of his throat.\\n\\n\"We are lost!\" exclaimed Alice, throwing herself into the arms of Cora.\\n\\n\"Not yet, not yet,\" returned the agitated but undaunted Heyward; \"the\\nsound came from the centre of the island, and it has been produced by\\nthe sight of their dead companions. We are not yet discovered, and there\\nis still hope.\"\\n\\nFaint and almost despairing as was the prospect of escape, the words of\\nDuncan were not thrown away, for it awakened the powers of the sisters\\nin such a manner that they awaited the result in silence. A second yell\\nsoon followed the first, when a rush of voices was heard pouring down\\nthe island, from its upper to its lower extremity, until they reached\\nthe naked rock above the caverns, where, after a shout of savage\\ntriumph, the air continued full of horrible cries and screams, such as\\nman alone can utter, and he only when in a state of the fiercest\\nbarbarity.\\n\\nThe sounds quickly spread around them in every direction. Some called to\\ntheir fellows from the water\\'s edge, and were answered from the heights\\nabove. Cries were heard in the startling vicinity of the chasm between\\nthe two caves, which mingled with hoarser yells that arose out of the\\nabyss of the deep ravine. In short, so rapidly had the savage sounds\\ndiffused themselves over the barren rock, that it was not difficult for\\nthe anxious listeners to imagine they could be heard beneath, as in\\ntruth they were above and on every side of them.\\n\\nIn the midst of this tumult, a triumphant yell was raised within a few\\nyards of the hidden entrance to the cave. Heyward abandoned every hope,\\nwith the belief it was the signal that they were discovered. Again the\\nimpression passed away, as he heard the voices collect near the spot\\nwhere the white man had so reluctantly abandoned his rifle. Amid the\\njargon of the Indian dialects that he now plainly heard, it was easy to\\ndistinguish not only words, but sentences, in the _patois_ of the\\nCanadas. A burst of voices had shouted simultaneously, \"La Longue\\nCarabine!\" causing the opposite woods to re-echo with a name which,\\nHeyward well remembered, had been given by his enemies to a celebrated\\nhunter and scout of the English camp, and who, he now learnt for the\\nfirst time, had been his late companion.\\n\\n\"La Longue Carabine! La Longue Carabine!\" passed from mouth to mouth,\\nuntil the whole band appeared to be collected around a trophy which\\nwould seem to announce the death of its formidable owner. After a\\nvociferous consultation, which was, at times, deafened by bursts of\\nsavage joy, they again separated, filling the air with the name of a\\nfoe, whose body, Heyward could collect from their expressions, they\\nhoped to find concealed in some crevice of the island.\\n\\n\"Now,\" he whispered to the trembling sisters, \"now is the moment of\\nuncertainty! if our place of retreat escape this scrutiny, we are still\\nsafe! In every event, we are assured, by what has fallen from our\\nenemies, that our friends have escaped, and in two short hours we may\\nlook for succor from Webb.\"\\n\\nThere were now a few minutes of fearful stillness, during which Heyward\\nwell knew that the savages conducted their search with greater vigilance\\nand method. More than once he could distinguish their footsteps, as they\\nbrushed the sassafras, causing the faded leaves to rustle, and the\\nbranches to snap. At length, the pile yielded a little, a corner of the\\nblanket fell, and a faint ray of light gleamed into the inner part of\\nthe cave. Cora folded Alice to her bosom in agony, and Duncan sprang to\\nhis feet. A shout was at that moment heard, as if issuing from the\\ncentre of the rock, announcing that the neighboring cavern had at length\\nbeen entered. In a minute, the number and loudness of the voices\\nindicated that the whole party was collected in and around that secret\\nplace.\\n\\nAs the inner passages to the two caves were so close to each other,\\nDuncan, believing that escape was no longer possible, passed David and\\nthe sisters, to place himself between the latter and the first onset of\\nthe terrible meeting. Grown desperate by his situation, he drew nigh the\\nslight barrier which separated him only by a few feet from his\\nrelentless pursuers, and placing his face to the casual opening, he even\\nlooked out, with a sort of desperate indifference, on their movements.\\n\\nWithin reach of his arm was the brawny shoulder of a gigantic Indian,\\nwhose deep and authoritative voice appeared to give directions to the\\nproceedings of his fellows. Beyond him again, Duncan could look into the\\nvault opposite, which was filled with savages, upturning and rifling the\\nhumble furniture of the scout. The wound of David had dyed the leaves of\\nsassafras with a color that the natives well knew was anticipating the\\nseason. Over this sign of their success, they set up a howl, like an\\nopening from so many hounds who had recovered a lost trail. After this\\nyell of victory, they tore up the fragrant bed of the cavern, and bore\\nthe branches into the chasm, scattering the boughs, as if they suspected\\nthem of concealing the person of the man they had so long hated and\\nfeared. One fierce and wild-looking warrior approached the chief\\nbearing a load of the brush, and pointing, exultingly, to the deep red\\nstains with which it was sprinkled, uttered his joy in Indian yells,\\nwhose meaning Heyward was only enabled to comprehend by the frequent\\nrepetition of the name of \"La Longue Carabine!\" When his triumph had\\nceased, he cast the brush on the slight heap that Duncan had made before\\nthe entrance of the second cavern, and closed the view. His example was\\nfollowed by others, who, as they drew the branches from the cave of the\\nscout, threw them into one pile, adding, unconsciously, to the security\\nof those they sought. The very slightness of the defence was its chief\\nmerit, for no one thought of disturbing a mass of brush, which all of\\nthem believed, in that moment of hurry and confusion, had been\\naccidentally raised by the hands of their own party.\\n\\nAs the blankets yielded before the outward pressure, and the branches\\nsettled in the fissure of the rock by their own weight, forming a\\ncompact body, Duncan once more breathed freely. With a light step, and\\nlighter heart, he returned to the centre of the cave, and took the place\\nhe had left, where he could command a view of the opening next the\\nriver. While he was in the act of making this movement, the Indians, as\\nif changing their purpose by a common impulse, broke away from the\\ncavern in a body, and were heard rushing up the island again, towards\\nthe point whence they had originally descended. Here another wailing cry\\nbetrayed that they were again collected around the bodies of their dead\\ncomrades.\\n\\nDuncan now ventured to look at his companions; for, during the most\\ncritical moments of their danger, he had been apprehensive that the\\nanxiety of his countenance might communicate some additional alarm to\\nthose who were so little able to sustain it.\\n\\n\"They are gone, Cora!\" he whispered; \"Alice, they are returned whence\\nthey came, and we are saved! To Heaven, that has alone delivered us from\\nthe grasp of so merciless an enemy, be all the praise!\"\\n\\n\"Then to Heaven will I return my thanks!\" exclaimed the younger sister,\\nrising from the encircling arms of Cora, and casting herself with\\nenthusiastic gratitude on the naked rock; \"to that Heaven who has spared\\nthe tears of a gray-headed father; has saved the lives of those I so\\nmuch love--\"\\n\\nBoth Heyward, and the more tempered Cora, witnessed the act of\\ninvoluntary emotion with powerful sympathy, the former secretly\\nbelieving that piety had never worn a form so lovely as it had now\\nassumed in the youthful person of Alice. Her eyes radiant with the glow\\nof grateful feelings; the flush of her beauty was again seated on her\\ncheeks, and her whole soul seemed ready and anxious to pour out its\\nthanksgivings, through the medium of her eloquent features. But when her\\nlips moved, the words they should have uttered appeared frozen by some\\nnew and sudden chill. Her bloom gave place to the paleness of death; her\\nsoft and melting eyes grew hard, and seemed contracting with horror;\\nwhile those hands which she had raised, clasped in each other, towards\\nheaven, dropped in horizontal lines before her, the fingers pointed\\nforward in convulsed motion. Heyward turned, the instant she gave a\\ndirection to his suspicions, and, peering just above the ledge which\\nformed the threshold of the open outlet of the cavern, he beheld the\\nmalignant, fierce, and savage features of Le Renard Subtil.\\n\\nIn that moment of surprise, the self-possession of Heyward did not\\ndesert him. He observed by the vacant expression of the Indian\\'s\\ncountenance, that his eye, accustomed to the open air, had not yet been\\nable to penetrate the dusky light which pervaded the depth of the\\ncavern. He had even thought of retreating beyond a curvature in the\\nnatural wall, which might still conceal him and his companions, when, by\\nthe sudden gleam of intelligence that shot across the features of the\\nsavage, he saw it was too late, and that they were betrayed.\\n\\nThe look of exultation and brutal triumph which announced this terrible\\ntruth was irresistibly irritating. Forgetful of everything but the\\nimpulses of his hot blood, Duncan levelled his pistol and fired. The\\nreport of the weapon made the cavern bellow like an eruption from a\\nvolcano; and when the smoke it vomited had been driven away before the\\ncurrent of air which issued from the ravine, the place so lately\\noccupied by the features of his treacherous guide was vacant. Rushing to\\nthe outlet, Heyward caught a glimpse of his dark figure, stealing around\\na low and narrow ledge, which soon hid him entirely from sight.\\n\\nAmong the savages, a frightful stillness succeeded the explosion, which\\nhad just been heard bursting from the bowels of the rock. But when Le\\nRenard raised his voice in a long and intelligible whoop, it was\\nanswered by a spontaneous yell from the mouth of every Indian within\\nhearing of the sound. The clamorous noises again rushed down the\\nisland; and before Duncan had time to recover from the shock, his feeble\\nbarrier of brush was scattered to the winds, the cavern was entered at\\nboth its extremities, and he and his companions were dragged from their\\nshelter and borne into the day, where they stood surrounded by the whole\\nband of the triumphant Hurons.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "    'summary_text': 'In the stillness that follows, Heyward finds it hard to believe what has happened, especially as nature seems to reassert itself with the song of birds. Nonetheless, they all hide in the cave, Gamut still addled and Alice trembling and weeping against Cora\\'s breast. The major closes the inner entrance with the blanket and a pile of sassafras, then seats himself with a pistol clenched convulsively in his hand. Gamut sings \"Isle of Wight,\" which is interrupted by savage yells from the center of the island as a rush of voices pours down the island. When a triumphant cry is followed by the shout, \"La Longue Carabine!\" Heyward for the first time realizes that his late companion was the celebrated hunter and scout of the English camp, and he feels certain that their friends have escaped. As the Indians enter the neighboring cavern, the major peers out of his sassafras entrance, sees the gigantic chief, and watches as exultant warriors bring blood-stained brush from the other cave and unwittingly pile it against his entrance. Though the Indians\\' shouts indicate anger in seeing their own dead and disappointment at finding no prisoners or dead enemies, Heyward feels that perhaps now they are safe. However, just as Alice begins to offer thanks, the features of Le Renard Subtil appear at the other entrance and the major fires his pistol without success. There is only a moment of surprise before a clamorous rush captures the four whites, who are dragged outside and surrounded by the triumphant Hurons.',\n",
       "    'summary_analysis': 'With the woodsmen off the scene of action, this chapter presents the relative ineffectiveness of the \"outsiders.\" As before, Alice is the sentimental heroine, trembling and ready to swoon so that she demands the attention of others. Gamut is still too much under the influence of his wound to learn anything from his situation yet; he mechanically follows his interest in song. It is notable that while Cooper continues to present him as a weak personage -- a weakness consistent with his naivete as a comic Yankee character -- he again credits the psalmodist with a singing voice so good that it can cast a spell even through a travesty of song. Heyward, still solicitous of the girls and especially of Alice, is seen as the determined but unsuccessful hero who is too much out of his element. Little is seen of Cora in the present action, but she remains a strong character in contrast to Alice. By the end of this chapter, the first segment of the plot pattern that Cooper works so well is completed: the pursuit, which was instigated earlier, has now reached the point of capture. What the reader can expect now are the possibility and difficulty of escape. Actually Cooper has already varied his pattern by letting three of the party escape before the capture. Plot thus adds hopeful suspense to the brutal threat of the obviously savage captors, made more threatening by the presence of the subtle Magua.',\n",

When he finally convinces them that the three woodsmen have escaped, they are furious, and one savage grabs Alice by the hair in a mock scalping. Before real violence can occur, the chief calls a brief council and the entire party crosses to the south bank of the river where the horses are. Mounted on Heyward\\'s charger, the chief leads most of his people away across river, leaving the prisoners in charge of six Indians headed by Magua. The major tries to secure Magua\\'s help by privately implying that he and the redskin have been in collusion to fool the Hurons all along and by offering rewards. Although Heyward adopts the sententious speech of the Indians, Magua is noncommittal as the group heads south, the sisters mounted and the others afoot. Flanked by the Indians, Cora finds it difficult to leave signs on the trail; once when she drops a glove, she is detected and severely warned by one of their conductors. Never speaking, Magua steadily leads the way through the forests and hills until they finally reach a steep, pyramidal hill with a level summit and few trees -- a perfect place for defense and for avoiding surprise. While the warriors eat the raw meat of a fawn, Heyward again engages Magua in talk. Heyward\\'s expression of Munro\\'s love for his daughters brings a gleam of malignant joy to the Indian\\'s face, and the latter insists upon a private talk with Cora. He proudly tells her that he was born a chief but that, after the Canadians taught him to drink firewater, he was driven from his tribe. Once when working for Munro, he came into Munro\\'s cabin drunk and the latter had him tied up and whipped like a dog before the soldiers. He demands, is it \\\\\"justice to make evil, and then punish for it?\\\\\" Wanting injury for injury, he says he will let Alice go if Cora will come with him as his wife: \\\\\"The body of the gray-head would sleep among his cannon, but his heart would lie within reach of the knife of Le Subtil.\\\\\" Cora is indignant and returns to her fellow captives. Magua goes to the lolling savages and begins a skillful harangue, building their emotions to the point of rage and vengeance. As they rush upon their prisoners with drawn knives and uplifted tomahawks, Magua villainously invites them to prolong the victims\\' misery. Heyward and Gamut struggle to no avail, and all four are tied to saplings while splinters and fire are prepared for the torture. Magua again makes his proposal, and Cora leaves the decision to Alice, who hesitates in her weakness but finally says no. Gnashing his teeth, the Huron hurls his tomahawk just above Alice\\'s head, cutting some of her ringlets. Maddened, Heyward snaps his bonds and rushes upon another Indian who is about to throw his weapon. In the struggle, Heyward goes down and the Indian raises his knife fatally. But the crack of a rifle is heard, and the Indian\\'s look changes to vacant wildness as he falls dead on the faded leaves beside Heyward.\", \"analysis\": \"These chapters are important for certain revelations and one presentation of status quo ante . The latter comes in Magua\\'s explaining his past; his noble birth and his deserved but ignoble treatment by Munro do not justify his present actions, but they do make him and his conduct believable. They also raise the questions of justice and the big context of shared responsibility. The revelations begin with Heyward\\'s learning of the fame of his two former Indian companions, Chingachgook as \\\\\"Le Gros Serpent\\\\\"  and Uncas as \\\\\"Le Cerf Agile\\\\\" . Magua makes clear not only his motives but also the alternative routes that he will let his vengeance take. Perhaps the most important is Gamut\\'s self-revelation when he struggles hand-to-hand with his captors: \\\\\"David had contended, and the novelty of the circumstance held him silent.\\\\\" The realities of frontier strife are beginning to impinge upon him. Two influences on Cooper\\'s fiction are also apparent. Indian lore comes forth in the figurative language of the natives, in the masterful and persuasive oratory of Magua, in the Hurons\\' contrasting silent patience and loud bloodthirstiness, and in methods of torture such as tying a man\\'s arms to the tops of two bent saplings that will recoil in different directions. Sentimental qualities appear in the reactions of the fragile Alice, in the extreme testing of Cora\\'s virtue and familial emotions, and in Heyward\\'s over-vocalized sense of duty and honor. Holding together all of these fictional elements is the plot device of the chase, through which a reversal of fortunes has occurred. Some of the pursued and some of the pursuers have exchanged their roles, while some have had relative security usurped by imminent danger and vice versa.\"}',\n",
       "    'chapter': '\\n  \"I fear we shall outsleep the coming morn\\n  As much as we this night have overwatched!\"\\n\\n  _Midsummer Night\\'s Dream._\\n\\n\\nThe instant the shock of this sudden misfortune had abated, Duncan began\\nto make his observations on the appearance and proceedings of their\\ncaptors. Contrary to the usages of the natives in the wantonness of\\ntheir success, they had respected, not only the persons of the trembling\\nsisters, but his own. The rich ornaments of his military attire had\\nindeed been repeatedly handled by different individuals of the tribe\\nwith eyes expressing a savage longing to possess the baubles; but before\\nthe customary violence could be resorted to, a mandate in the\\nauthoritative voice of the large warrior already mentioned, stayed the\\nuplifted hand, and convinced Heyward that they were to be reserved for\\nsome object of particular moment.\\n\\nWhile, however, these manifestations of weakness were exhibited by the\\nyoung and vain of the party, the more experienced warriors continued\\ntheir search throughout both caverns, with an activity that denoted they\\nwere far from being satisfied with those fruits of their conquest which\\nhad already been brought to light. Unable to discover any new victim,\\nthese diligent workers of vengeance soon approached their male\\nprisoners, pronouncing the name of \"La Longue Carabine,\" with a\\nfierceness that could not easily be mistaken. Duncan affected not to\\ncomprehend the meaning of their repeated and violent interrogatories,\\nwhile his companion was spared the effort of a similar deception by his\\nignorance of French. Wearied, at length, by their importunities, and\\napprehensive of irritating his captors by too stubborn a silence, the\\nformer looked about him in quest of Magua; who might interpret his\\nanswers to questions which were at each moment becoming more earnest and\\nthreatening.\\n\\nThe conduct of this savage had formed a solitary exception to that of\\nall his fellows. While the others were busily occupied in seeking to\\ngratify their childish passion for finery, by plundering even the\\nmiserable effects of the scout, or had been searching, with such\\nbloodthirsty vengeance in their looks, for their absent owner, Le Renard\\nhad stood at a little distance from the prisoners, with a demeanor so\\nquiet and satisfied, as to betray that he had already effected the grand\\npurpose of this treachery. When the eyes of Heyward first met those of\\nhis recent guide, he turned them away in horror at the sinister though\\ncalm look he encountered. Conquering his disgust, however, he was able,\\nwith an averted face, to address his successful enemy.\\n\\n\"Le Renard Subtil is too much of a warrior,\" said the reluctant Heyward,\\n\"to refuse telling an unarmed man what his conquerors say.\"\\n\\n\"They ask for the hunter who knows the paths through the woods,\"\\nreturned Magua, in his broken English, laying his hand, at the same\\ntime, with a ferocious smile, on the bundle of leaves with which a wound\\non his own shoulder was bandaged. \"La Longue Carabine! his rifle is\\ngood, and his eye never shut; but, like the short gun of the white\\nchief, it is nothing against the life of Le Subtil!\"\\n\\n\"Le Renard is too brave to remember the hurts received in war, or the\\nhands that gave them!\"\\n\\n\"Was it war, when the tired Indian rested at the sugar-tree to taste his\\ncorn! who filled the bushes with creeping enemies! who drew the knife!\\nwhose tongue was peace, while his heart was colored with blood! Did\\nMagua say that the hatchet was out of the ground, and that his hand had\\ndug it up?\"\\n\\nAs Duncan dared not retort upon his accuser by reminding him of his own\\npremeditated treachery, and disdained to deprecate his resentment by any\\nwords of apology, he remained silent. Magua seemed also content to rest\\nthe controversy as well as all further communication there, for he\\nresumed the leaning attitude against the rock, from which, in momentary\\nenergy, he had arisen. But the cry of \"La Longue Carabine\" was renewed\\nthe instant the impatient savages perceived that the short dialogue was\\nended.\\n\\n\"You hear,\" said Magua, with stubborn indifference; \"the red Hurons call\\nfor the life of \\'The Long Rifle,\\' or they will have the blood of them\\nthat keep him hid!\"\\n\\n\"He is gone--escaped; he is far beyond their reach.\"\\n\\nRenard smiled with cold contempt, as he answered,--\\n\\n\"When the white man dies, he thinks he is at peace; but the redmen know\\nhow to torture even the ghosts of their enemies. Where is his body? Let\\nthe Hurons see his scalp!\"\\n\\n\"He is not dead, but escaped.\"\\n\\nMagua shook his head incredulously.\\n\\n\"Is he a bird, to spread his wings; or is he a fish, to swim without\\nair! The white chief reads in his books, and he believes the Hurons are\\nfools!\"\\n\\n\"Though no fish, The Long Rifle can swim. He floated down the stream\\nwhen the powder was all burnt, and when the eyes of the Hurons were\\nbehind a cloud.\"\\n\\n\"And why did the white chief stay?\" demanded the still incredulous\\nIndian. \"Is he a stone that goes to the bottom, or does the scalp burn\\nhis head?\"\\n\\n\"That I am not a stone, your dead comrade, who fell into the falls,\\nmight answer, were the life still in him,\" said the provoked young man,\\nusing, in his anger, that boastful language which was most likely to\\nexcite the admiration of an Indian. \"The white man thinks none but\\ncowards desert their women.\"\\n\\nMagua muttered a few words, inaudibly, between his teeth, before he\\ncontinued, aloud,--\\n\\n\"Can the Delawares swim, too, as well as crawl in the bushes? Where is\\nLe Gros Serpent?\"\\n\\nDuncan, who perceived by the use of these Canadian appellations, that\\nhis late companions were much better known to his enemies than to\\nhimself, answered, reluctantly, \"He also is gone down with the water.\"\\n\\n\"Le Cerf Agile is not here?\"\\n\\n\"I know not whom you call \\'The Nimble Deer,\\'\" said Duncan, gladly\\nprofiting by any excuse to create delay.\\n\\n\"Uncas,\" returned Magua, pronouncing the Delaware name with even greater\\ndifficulty than he spoke his English words. \"\\'Bounding Elk\\' is what the\\nwhite man says, when he calls to the young Mohican.\"\\n\\n\"Here is some confusion in names between us, Le Renard,\" said Duncan,\\nhoping to provoke a discussion. \"_Daim_ is the French for deer, and\\n_cerf_ for stag; _elan_ is the true term, when one would speak of an\\nelk.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" muttered the Indian, in his native tongue; \"the pale-faces are\\nprattling women! they have two words for each thing, while a redskin\\nwill make the sound of his voice speak for him.\" Then changing his\\nlanguage, he continued, adhering to the imperfect nomenclature of his\\nprovincial instructors, \"The deer is swift, but weak; the elk is swift,\\nbut strong; and the son of Le Serpent is Le Cerf Agile. Has he leaped\\nthe river to the woods?\"\\n\\n\"If you mean the younger Delaware, he too is gone down with the water.\"\\n\\nAs there was nothing improbable to an Indian in the manner of the\\nescape, Magua admitted the truth of what he had heard, with a readiness\\nthat afforded additional evidence how little he would prize such\\nworthless captives. With his companions, however, the feeling was\\nmanifestly different.\\n\\nThe Hurons had awaited the result of this short dialogue with\\ncharacteristic patience, and with a silence that increased until there\\nwas a general stillness in the band. When Heyward ceased to speak, they\\nturned their eyes, as one man, on Magua, demanding, in this expressive\\nmanner, an explanation of what had been said. Their interpreter pointed\\nto the river, and made them acquainted with the result, as much by the\\naction as by the few words he uttered. When the fact was generally\\nunderstood, the savages raised a frightful yell, which declared the\\nextent of their disappointment. Some ran furiously to the water\\'s edge,\\nbeating the air with frantic gestures, while others spat upon the\\nelement, to resent the supposed treason it had committed against their\\nacknowledged rights as conquerors. A few, and they not the least\\npowerful and terrific of the band, threw lowering looks, in which the\\nfiercest passion was only tempered by habitual self-command, at those\\ncaptives who still remained in their power; while one or two even gave\\nvent to their malignant feelings by the most menacing gestures, against\\nwhich neither the sex nor the beauty of the sisters was any protection.\\nThe young soldier made a desperate, but fruitless effort, to spring to\\nthe side of Alice, when he saw the dark hand of a savage twisted in the\\nrich tresses which were flowing in volumes over her shoulders, while a\\nknife was passed around the head from which they fell, as if to denote\\nthe horrid manner in which it was about to be robbed of its beautiful\\nornament. But his hands were bound; and at the first movement he made,\\nhe felt the grasp of the powerful Indian who directed the band, pressing\\nhis shoulder like a vise. Immediately conscious how unavailing any\\nstruggle against such an overwhelming force must prove, he submitted to\\nhis fate, encouraging his gentle companions by a few low and tender\\nassurances that the natives seldom failed to threaten more than they\\nperformed.\\n\\nBut, while Duncan resorted to these words of consolation to quiet the\\napprehensions of the sisters, he was not so weak as to deceive himself.\\nHe well knew that the authority of an Indian chief was so little\\nconventional, that it was oftener maintained by physical superiority\\nthan by any moral supremacy he might possess. The danger was, therefore,\\nmagnified exactly in proportion to the number of the savage spirits by\\nwhich they were surrounded. The most positive mandate from him who\\nseemed the acknowledged leader, was liable to be violated at each\\nmoment, by any rash hand that might choose to sacrifice a victim to the\\n_manes_ of some dead friend or relative. While, therefore, he sustained\\nan outward appearance of calmness and fortitude, his heart leaped into\\nhis throat, whenever any of their fierce captors drew nearer than common\\nto the helpless sisters, or fastened one of their sullen wandering looks\\non those fragile forms which were so little able to resist the slightest\\nassault.\\n\\nHis apprehensions were, however, greatly relieved, when he saw that the\\nleader had summoned his warriors to himself in council. Their\\ndeliberations were short, and it would seem, by the silence of most of\\nthe party, the decision unanimous. By the frequency with which the few\\nspeakers pointed in the direction of the encampment of Webb, it was\\napparent they dreaded the approach of danger from that quarter. This\\nconsideration probably hastened their determination, and quickened the\\nsubsequent movements.\\n\\nDuring this short conference, Heyward, finding a respite from his\\ngreatest fears, had leisure to admire the cautious manner in which the\\nHurons had made their approaches, even after hostilities had ceased.\\n\\nIt has already been stated, that the upper half of the island was a\\nnaked rock, and destitute of any other defences than a few scattered\\nlogs of drift-wood. They had selected this point to make their descent,\\nhaving borne the canoe through the wood around the cataract for that\\npurpose. Placing their arms in the little vessel, a dozen men clinging\\nto its sides had trusted themselves to the direction of the canoe, which\\nwas controlled by two of the most skilful warriors, in attitudes that\\nenabled them to command a view of the dangerous passage. Favored by this\\narrangement, they touched the head of the island at that point which had\\nproved so fatal to their first adventures, but with the advantages of\\nsuperior numbers, and the possession of fire-arms. That such had been\\nthe manner of their descent was rendered quite apparent to Duncan; for\\nthey now bore the light bark from the upper end of the rock, and placed\\nit in the water, near the mouth of the outer cavern. As soon as this\\nchange was made, the leader made signs to the prisoners to descend and\\nenter.\\n\\nAs resistance was impossible, and remonstrance useless, Heyward set the\\nexample of submission, by leading the way into the canoe, where he was\\nsoon seated with the sisters, and the still wondering David.\\nNotwithstanding the Hurons were necessarily ignorant of the little\\nchannels among the eddies and rapids of the stream, they knew the common\\nsigns of such a navigation too well to commit any material blunder. When\\nthe pilot chosen for the task of guiding the canoe had taken his\\nstation, the whole band plunged again into the river, the vessel glided\\ndown the current, and in a few moments the captives found themselves on\\nthe south bank of the stream, nearly opposite to the point where they\\nhad struck it the preceding evening.\\n\\nHere was held another short but earnest consultation, during which the\\nhorses, to whose panic their owners ascribed their heaviest misfortune,\\nwere led from the cover of the woods, and brought to the sheltered spot.\\nThe band now divided. The great chief so often mentioned, mounting the\\ncharger of Heyward, led the way directly across the river, followed by\\nmost of his people, and disappeared in the woods, leaving the prisoners\\nin charge of six savages, at whose head was Le Renard Subtil. Duncan\\nwitnessed all their movements with renewed uneasiness.\\n\\nHe had been fond of believing, from the uncommon forbearance of the\\nsavages, that he was reserved as a prisoner to be delivered to Montcalm.\\nAs the thoughts of those who are in misery seldom slumber, and the\\ninvention is never more lively than when it is stimulated by hope,\\nhowever feeble and remote, he had even imagined that the parental\\nfeelings of Munro were to be made instrumental in seducing him from his\\nduty to the king. For though the French commander bore a high character\\nfor courage and enterprise, he was also thought to be expert in those\\npolitical practices, which do not always respect the nicer obligations\\nof morality, and which so generally disgraced the European diplomacy of\\nthat period.\\n\\nAll those busy and ingenious speculations were now annihilated by the\\nconduct of his captors. That portion of the band who had followed the\\nhuge warrior took the route towards the foot of the Horican, and no\\nother expectation was left for himself and companions, than that they\\nwere to be retained as hopeless captives by their savage conquerors.\\nAnxious to know the worst, and willing, in such an emergency, to try the\\npotency of gold, he overcame his reluctance to speak to Magua.\\nAddressing himself to his former guide, who had now assumed the\\nauthority and manner of one who was to direct the future movements of\\nthe party, he said, in tones as friendly and confiding as he could\\nassume,--\\n\\n\"I would speak to Magua, what is fit only for so great a chief to hear.\"\\n\\nThe Indian turned his eyes on the young soldier scornfully, as he\\nanswered,--\\n\\n\"Speak; trees have no ears!\"\\n\\n\"But the red Hurons are not deaf; and counsel that is fit for the great\\nmen of a nation would make the young warriors drunk. If Magua will not\\nlisten, the officer of the king knows how to be silent.\"\\n\\nThe savage spoke carelessly to his comrades, who were busied, after\\ntheir awkward manner, in preparing the horses for the reception of the\\nsisters, and moved a little to one side, whither, by a cautious gesture,\\nhe induced Heyward to follow.\\n\\n\"Now speak,\" he said; \"if the words are such as Magua should hear.\"\\n\\n\"Le Renard Subtil has proved himself worthy of the honorable name given\\nto him by his Canada fathers,\" commenced Heyward; \"I see his wisdom, and\\nall that he has done for us, and shall remember it, when the hour to\\nreward him arrives. Yes! Renard has proved that he is not only a great\\nchief in council, but one who knows how to deceive his enemies!\"\\n\\n\"What has Renard done?\" coldly demanded the Indian.\\n\\n\"What! has he not seen that the woods were filled with outlying parties\\nof the enemies, and that the Serpent could not steal through them\\nwithout being seen? Then, did he not lose his path to blind the eyes of\\nthe Hurons? Did he not pretend to go back to his tribe, who had treated\\nhim ill, and driven him from their wigwams like a dog? And, when we saw\\nwhat he wished to do, did we not aid him, by making a false face, that\\nthe Hurons might think the white man believed that his friend was his\\nenemy? Is not all this true? And when Le Subtil had shut the eyes and\\nstopped the ears of his nation by his wisdom, did they not forget that\\nthey had once done him wrong, and forced him to flee to the Mohawks? And\\ndid they not leave him on the south side of the river, with their\\nprisoners, while they have gone foolishly on the north? Does not Renard\\nmean to turn like a fox on his footsteps, and to carry to the rich and\\ngray-headed Scotchman his daughters? Yes, Magua, I see it all, and I\\nhave already been thinking how so much wisdom and honesty should be\\nrepaid. First, the chief of William Henry will give as a great chief\\nshould for such a service. The medal[16] of Magua will no longer be of\\ntin, but of beaten gold; his horn will run over with powder; dollars\\nwill be as plenty in his pouch as pebbles on the shore of Horican; and\\nthe deer will lick his hand, for they will know it to be vain to fly\\nfrom the rifle he will carry! As for myself, I know not how to exceed\\nthe gratitude of the Scotchman, but I--yes, I will--\"\\n\\n\"What will the young chief who comes from towards the sun, give?\"\\ndemanded the Huron, observing that Heyward hesitated in his desire to\\nend the enumeration of benefits with that which might form the climax of\\nan Indian\\'s wishes.\\n\\n\"He will make the fire-water from the Islands in the salt lake flow\\nbefore the wigwam of Magua, until the heart of the Indian shall be\\nlighter than the feathers of the humming-bird, and his breath sweeter\\nthan the wild honeysuckle.\"\\n\\nLe Renard had listened gravely as Heyward slowly proceeded in his subtle\\nspeech. When the young man mentioned the artifice he supposed the Indian\\nto have practised on his own nation, the countenance of the listener was\\nveiled in an expression of cautious gravity. At the allusion to the\\ninjury which Duncan affected to believe had driven the Huron from his\\nnative tribe, a gleam of such ungovernable ferocity flashed from the\\nother\\'s eyes, as induced the adventurous speaker to believe he had\\nstruck the proper chord. And by the time he reached the part where he so\\nartfully blended the thirst of vengeance with the desire of gain, he\\nhad, at least, obtained a command of the deepest attention of the\\nsavage. The question put by Le Renard had been calm, and with all the\\ndignity of an Indian; but it was quite apparent, by the thoughtful\\nexpression of the listener\\'s countenance, that the answer was most\\ncunningly devised. The Huron mused a few moments, and then laying his\\nhand on the rude bandages of his wounded shoulder, he said, with some\\nenergy,--\\n\\n\"Do friends make such remarks?\"\\n\\n\"Would La Longue Carabine cut one so light on an enemy?\"\\n\\n\"Do the Delawares crawl upon those they love, like snakes, twisting\\nthemselves to strike?\"\\n\\n\"Would Le Gros Serpent have been heard by the ears of one he wished to\\nbe deaf?\"\\n\\n\"Does the white chief burn his powder in the faces of his brothers?\"\\n\\n\"Does he ever miss his aim, when seriously bent to kill?\" returned\\nDuncan, smiling with well acted sincerity.\\n\\nAnother long and deliberate pause succeeded these sententious questions\\nand ready replies. Duncan saw that the Indian hesitated. In order to\\ncomplete his victory, he was in the act of recommencing the enumeration\\nof the rewards, when Magua made an expressive gesture and said--\\n\\n\"Enough; Le Renard is a wise chief, and what he does will be seen. Go,\\nand keep the mouth shut. When Magua speaks, it will be the time to\\nanswer.\"\\n\\nHeyward, perceiving that the eyes of his companion were warily fastened\\non the rest of the band, fell back immediately, in order to avoid the\\nappearance of any suspicious confederacy with their leader. Magua\\napproached the horses, and affected to be well pleased with the\\ndiligence and ingenuity of his comrades. He then signed to Heyward to\\nassist the sisters into the saddles, for he seldom deigned to use the\\nEnglish tongue, unless urged by some motive of more than usual moment.\\n\\nThere was no longer any plausible pretext for delay; and Duncan was\\nobliged, however reluctantly, to comply. As he performed this office, he\\nwhispered his reviving hopes in the ears of the trembling females, who,\\nthrough dread of encountering the savage countenances of their captors,\\nseldom raised their eyes from the ground. The mare of David had been\\ntaken with the followers of the large chief; in consequence, its owner,\\nas well as Duncan, was compelled to journey on foot. The latter did not,\\nhowever, so much regret this circumstance, as it might enable him to\\nretard the speed of the party; for he still turned his longing looks in\\nthe direction of Fort Edward, in the vain expectation of catching some\\nsound from that quarter of the forest, which might denote the approach\\nof succor.\\n\\nWhen all were prepared, Magua made the signal to proceed, advancing in\\nfront to lead the party in person. Next followed David, who was\\ngradually coming to a true sense of his condition, as the effects of the\\nwound became less and less apparent. The sisters rode in his rear, with\\nHeyward at their side, while the Indians flanked the party, and brought\\nup the close of the march, with a caution that seemed never to tire.\\n\\nIn this manner they proceeded in uninterrupted silence, except when\\nHeyward addressed some solitary word of comfort to the females, or David\\ngave vent to the moanings of his spirit in piteous exclamations, which\\nhe intended should express the humility of resignation. Their direction\\nlay towards the south, and in a course nearly opposite to the road to\\nWilliam Henry. Notwithstanding this apparent adherence in Magua to the\\noriginal determination of his conquerors, Heyward could not believe his\\ntempting bait was so soon forgotten; and he knew the windings of an\\nIndian path too well, to suppose that its apparent course led directly\\nto its object, when artifice was at all necessary. Mile after mile was,\\nhowever, passed through the boundless woods, in this painful manner,\\nwithout any prospect of a termination to their journey. Heyward watched\\nthe sun, as he darted his meridian rays through the branches of the\\ntrees, and pined for the moment when the policy of Magua should change\\ntheir route to one more favorable to his hopes. Sometimes he fancied the\\nwary savage, despairing of passing the arm of Montcalm in safety, was\\nholding his way towards a well-known border settlement, where a\\ndistinguished officer of the crown, and a favored friend of the Six\\nNations, held his large possessions, as well as his usual residence. To\\nbe delivered into the hands of Sir William Johnson was far preferable to\\nbeing led into the wilds of Canada; but in order to effect even the\\nformer, it would be necessary to traverse the forest for many weary\\nleagues, each step of which was carrying him farther from the scene of\\nthe war, and, consequently, from the post, not only of honor, but of\\nduty.\\n\\nCora alone remembered the parting injunctions of the scout, and whenever\\nan opportunity offered, she stretched forth her arm to bend aside the\\ntwigs that met her hands. But the vigilance of the Indians rendered this\\nact of precaution both difficult and dangerous. She was often defeated\\nin her purpose, by encountering their watchful eyes, when it became\\nnecessary to feign an alarm she did not feel, and occupy the limb by\\nsome gesture of feminine apprehension. Once, and once only, was she\\ncompletely successful; when she broke down the bough of a large sumach,\\nand, by a sudden thought, let her glove fall at the same instant. This\\nsign, intended for those that might follow, was observed by one of her\\nconductors, who restored the glove, broke the remaining branches of the\\nbush in such a manner that it appeared to proceed from the struggling of\\nsome beast in its branches, and then laid his hand on his tomahawk, with\\na look so significant, that it put an effectual end to these stolen\\nmemorials of their passage.\\n\\nAs there were horses, to leave the prints of their footsteps, in both\\nbands of the Indians, this interruption cut off any probable hopes of\\nassistance being conveyed through the means of their trail.\\n\\nHeyward would have ventured a remonstrance, had there been anything\\nencouraging in the gloomy reserve of Magua. But the savage, during all\\nthis time, seldom turned to look at his followers, and never spoke. With\\nthe sun for his only guide, or aided by such blind marks as are only\\nknown to the sagacity of a native, he held his way along the barrens of\\npine, through occasional little fertile vales, across brooks and\\nrivulets, and over undulating hills, with the accuracy of instinct, and\\nnearly with the directness of a bird. He never seemed to hesitate.\\nWhether the path was hardly distinguishable, whether it disappeared, or\\nwhether it lay beaten and plain before him, made no sensible difference\\nin his speed or certainty. It seemed as if fatigue could not affect him.\\nWhenever the eyes of the wearied travellers rose from the decayed leaves\\nover which they trod, his dark form was to be seen glancing among the\\nstems of the trees in front, his head immovably fastened in a forward\\nposition, with the light plume on his crest fluttering in a current of\\nair, made solely by the swiftness of his own motion.\\n\\nBut all this diligence and speed were not without an object. After\\ncrossing a low vale, through which a gushing brook meandered, he\\nsuddenly ascended a hill, so steep and difficult of ascent, that the\\nsisters were compelled to alight, in order to follow. When the summit\\nwas gained, they found themselves on a level spot, but thinly covered\\nwith trees, under one of which Magua had thrown his dark form, as if\\nwilling and ready to seek that rest which was so much needed by the\\nwhole party.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            \"Cursed by my tribe\\n  If I forgive him.\"\\n\\n  _Shylock._\\n\\n\\nThe Indian had selected, for this desirable purpose, one of those steep,\\npyramidal hills, which bear a strong resemblance to artificial mounds,\\nand which so frequently occur in the valleys of America. The one in\\nquestion was high and precipitous; its top flattened, as usual; but with\\none of its sides more than ordinarily irregular. It possessed no other\\napparent advantage for a resting-place than in its elevation and form,\\nwhich might render defence easy, and surprise nearly impossible. As\\nHeyward, however, no longer expected that rescue which time and distance\\nnow rendered so improbable, he regarded these little peculiarities with\\nan eye devoid of interest, devoting himself entirely to the comfort and\\ncondolence of his feebler companions. The Narragansetts were suffered to\\nbrowse on the branches of the trees and shrubs that were thinly\\nscattered over the summit of the hill, while the remains of their\\nprovisions were spread under the shade of a beech, that stretched its\\nhorizontal limbs like a canopy above them.\\n\\nNotwithstanding the swiftness of their flight, one of the Indians had\\nfound an opportunity to strike a straggling fawn with an arrow, and had\\nborne the more preferable fragments of the victim patiently on his\\nshoulders, to the stopping-place. Without any aid from the science of\\ncookery, he was immediately employed, in common with his fellows, in\\ngorging himself with this digestible sustenance. Magua alone sat apart,\\nwithout participation in the revolting meal, and apparently buried in\\nthe deepest thought.\\n\\nThis abstinence, so remarkable in an Indian, when he possessed the means\\nof satisfying hunger, at length attracted the notice of Heyward. The\\nyoung man willingly believed that the Huron deliberated on the most\\neligible manner of eluding the vigilance of his associates. With a view\\nto assist his plans, by any suggestion of his own, and to strengthen the\\ntemptation, he left the beech, and straggled as if without an object, to\\nthe spot where Le Renard was seated.\\n\\n\"Has not Magua kept the sun in his face long enough to escape all danger\\nfrom the Canadians?\" he asked, as though no longer doubtful of the good\\nintelligence established between them; \"and will not the chief of\\nWilliam Henry be better pleased to see his daughters before another\\nnight may have hardened his heart to their loss, to make him less\\nliberal in his reward?\"\\n\\n\"Do the pale-faces love their children less in the morning than at\\nnight?\" asked the Indian, coldly.\\n\\n\"By no means,\" returned Heyward, anxious to recall his error, if he had\\nmade one; \"the white man may, and does often, forget the burial-place of\\nhis fathers; he sometimes ceases to remember those he should love and\\nhas promised to cherish; but the affection of a parent for his child is\\nnever permitted to die.\"\\n\\n\"And is the heart of the white-headed chief soft, and will he think of\\nthe babes that his squaws have given him? He is hard to his warriors,\\nand his eyes are made of stone!\"\\n\\n\"He is severe to the idle and wicked, but to the sober and deserving he\\nis a leader, but just and humane. I have known many fond and tender\\nparents, but never have I seen a man whose heart was softer towards his\\nchild. You have seen the gray-head in front of his warriors, Magua; but\\nI have seen his eyes swimming in water, when he spoke of those children\\nwho are now in your power!\"\\n\\nHeyward paused, for he knew not how to construe the remarkable\\nexpression that gleamed across the swarthy features of the attentive\\nIndian. At first it seemed as if the remembrance of the promised reward\\ngrew vivid in his mind, while he listened to the sources of parental\\nfeeling which were to assure its possession; but as Duncan proceeded,\\nthe expression of joy became so fiercely malignant, that it was\\nimpossible not to apprehend it proceeded from some passion more sinister\\nthan avarice.\\n\\n\"Go,\" said the Huron, suppressing the alarming exhibition in an instant,\\nin a death-like calmness of countenance; \"go to the dark-haired\\ndaughter, and say, Magua waits to speak. The father will remember what\\nthe child promises.\"\\n\\nDuncan, who interpreted this speech to express a wish for some\\nadditional pledge that the promised gifts should not be withheld,\\nslowly and reluctantly repaired to the place where the sisters were now\\nresting from their fatigue, to communicate its purport to Cora.\\n\\n\"You understand the nature of an Indian\\'s wishes,\" he concluded, as he\\nled her towards the place where she was expected, \"and must be prodigal\\nof your offers of powder and blankets. Ardent spirits are, however, the\\nmost prized by such as he; nor would it be amiss to add some boon from\\nyour own hand, with that grace you so well know how to practise.\\nRemember, Cora, that on your presence of mind and ingenuity even your\\nlife, as well as that of Alice, may in some measure depend.\"\\n\\n\"Heyward, and yours!\"\\n\\n\"Mine is of little moment; it is already sold to my king, and is a prize\\nto be seized by any enemy who may possess the power. I have no father to\\nexpect me, and but few friends to lament a fate which I have courted\\nwith the insatiable longings of youth after distinction. But hush! we\\napproach the Indian. Magua, the lady with whom you wish to speak is\\nhere.\"\\n\\nThe Indian rose slowly from his seat, and stood for near a minute silent\\nand motionless. He then signed with his hand for Heyward to retire,\\nsaying coldly,--\\n\\n\"When the Huron talks to the women, his tribe shut their ears.\"\\n\\nDuncan, still lingering, as if refusing to comply, Cora said, with a\\ncalm smile--\\n\\n\"You hear, Heyward, and delicacy at least should urge you to retire. Go\\nto Alice, and comfort her with our reviving prospects.\"\\n\\nShe waited until he had departed, and then turning to the native, with\\nthe dignity of her sex in her voice and manner, she added, \"What would\\nLe Renard say to the daughter of Munro?\"\\n\\n\"Listen,\" said the Indian, laying his hand firmly upon her arm, as if\\nwilling to draw her utmost attention to his words; a movement that Cora\\nas firmly but quietly repulsed, by extricating the limb from his grasp:\\n\"Magua was born a chief and a warrior among the red Hurons of the lakes;\\nhe saw the suns of twenty summers make the snows of twenty winters run\\noff in the streams, before he saw a pale-face; and he was happy! Then\\nhis Canada fathers came into the woods, and taught him to drink the\\nfire-water, and he became a rascal. The Hurons drove him from the graves\\nof his fathers, as they would chase the hunted buffalo. He ran down the\\nshores of the lakes, and followed their outlet to the \\'city of cannon.\\'\\nThere he hunted and fished, till the people chased him again through the\\nwoods into the arms of his enemies. The chief, who was born a Huron, was\\nat last a warrior among the Mohawks!\"\\n\\n\"Something like this I had heard before,\" said Cora, observing that he\\npaused to suppress those passions which began to burn with too bright a\\nflame, as he recalled the recollection of his supposed injuries.\\n\\n\"Was it the fault of Le Renard that his head was not made of rock? Who\\ngave him the fire-water? who made him a villain? \\'Twas the pale-faces,\\nthe people of your own color.\"\\n\\n\"And am I answerable that thoughtless and unprincipled men exist, whose\\nshades of countenance may resemble mine?\" Cora calmly demanded of the\\nexcited savage.\\n\\n\"No; Magua is a man, and not a fool; such as you never open their lips\\nto the burning stream: the Great Spirit has given you wisdom!\"\\n\\n\"What then have I to do, or say, in the matter of your misfortunes, not\\nto say of your errors?\"\\n\\n\"Listen,\" repeated the Indian, resuming his earnest attitude; \"when his\\nEnglish and French fathers dug up the hatchet, Le Renard struck the\\nwar-post of the Mohawks, and went out against his own nation. The\\npale-faces have driven the redskins from their hunting-grounds, and now\\nwhen they fight, a white man leads the way. The old chief at Horican,\\nyour father, was the great captain of our war-party. He said to the\\nMohawks do this, and do that, and he was minded. He made a law, that if\\nan Indian swallowed the fire-water, and came into the cloth wigwams of\\nhis warriors, it should not be forgotten. Magua foolishly opened his\\nmouth, and the hot liquor led him into the cabin of Munro. What did the\\ngray-head? let his daughter say.\"\\n\\n\"He forgot not his words, and did justice by punishing the offender,\"\\nsaid the undaunted daughter.\\n\\n\"Justice!\" repeated the Indian, casting an oblique glance of the most\\nferocious expression at her unyielding countenance; \"is it justice to\\nmake evil, and then punish for it? Magua was not himself; it was the\\nfire-water that spoke and acted for him! but Munro did not believe it.\\nThe Huron chief was tied up before all the pale-faced warriors, and\\nwhipped like a dog.\"\\n\\nCora remained silent, for she knew not how to palliate this imprudent\\nseverity on the part of her father, in a manner to suit the\\ncomprehension of an Indian.\\n\\n\"See!\" continued Magua, tearing aside the slight calico that very\\nimperfectly concealed his painted breast; \"here are scars given by\\nknives and bullets--of these a warrior may boast before his nation; but\\nthe gray-head has left marks on the back of the Huron chief, that he\\nmust hide, like a squaw, under this painted cloth of the whites.\"\\n\\n\"I had thought,\" resumed Cora, \"that an Indian warrior was patient, and\\nthat his spirit felt not, and knew not, the pain his body suffered.\"\\n\\n\"When the Chippewas tied Magua to the stake, and cut this gash,\" said\\nthe other, laying his finger on a deep scar, \"the Huron laughed in their\\nfaces, and told them, Women struck so light! His spirit was then in the\\nclouds! But when he felt the blows of Munro, his spirit lay under the\\nbirch. The spirit of a Huron is never drunk; it remembers forever!\"\\n\\n\"But it may be appeased. If my father has done you this injustice, show\\nhim how an Indian can forgive an injury, and take back his daughters.\\nYou have heard from Major Heyward--\"\\n\\nMagua shook his head, forbidding the repetition of offers he so much\\ndespised.\\n\\n\"What would you have?\" continued Cora, after a most painful pause, while\\nthe conviction forced itself on her mind that the too sanguine and\\ngenerous Duncan had been cruelly deceived by the cunning of the savage.\\n\\n\"What a Huron loves--good for good; bad for bad!\"\\n\\n\"You would then revenge the injury inflicted by Munro on his helpless\\ndaughters. Would it not be more like a man to go before his face, and\\ntake the satisfaction of a warrior?\"\\n\\n\"The arms of the pale-faces are long, and their knives sharp!\" returned\\nthe savage, with a malignant laugh: \"why should Le Renard go among the\\nmuskets of his warriors, when he holds the spirit of the gray-head in\\nhis hand?\"\\n\\n\"Name your intention, Magua,\" said Cora, struggling with herself to\\nspeak with steady calmness. \"Is it to lead us prisoners to the woods, or\\ndo you contemplate even some greater evil? Is there no reward, no means\\nof palliating the injury, and of softening your heart? At least, release\\nmy gentle sister, and pour out all your malice on me. Purchase wealth by\\nher safety, and satisfy your revenge with a single victim. The loss of\\nboth of his daughters might bring the aged man to his grave, and where\\nwould then be the satisfaction of Le Renard?\"\\n\\n\"Listen,\" said the Indian again. \"The light eyes can go back to the\\nHorican, and tell the old chief what has been done, if the dark-haired\\nwoman will swear by the Great Spirit of her fathers to tell no lie.\"\\n\\n\"What must I promise?\" demanded Cora, still maintaining a secret\\nascendency over the fierce native, by the collected and feminine dignity\\nof her presence.\\n\\n\"When Magua left his people, his wife was given to another chief; he has\\nnow made friends with the Hurons, and will go back to the graves of his\\ntribe, on the shores of the great lake. Let the daughter of the English\\nchief follow, and live in his wigwam forever.\"\\n\\nHowever revolting a proposal of such a character might prove to Cora,\\nshe retained, notwithstanding her powerful disgust, sufficient\\nself-command to reply, without betraying the weakness.\\n\\n\"And what pleasure would Magua find in sharing his cabin with a wife he\\ndid not love; one who would be of a nation and color different from his\\nown? It would be better to take the gold of Munro, and buy the heart of\\nsome Huron maid with his gifts.\"\\n\\nThe Indian made no reply for near a minute, but bent his fierce looks on\\nthe countenance of Cora, in such wavering glances, that her eyes sank\\nwith shame, under an impression that, for the first time, they had\\nencountered an expression that no chaste female might endure. While she\\nwas shrinking within herself, in dread of having her ears wounded by\\nsome proposal still more shocking than the last, the voice of Magua\\nanswered, in its tones of deepest malignancy--\\n\\n\"When the blows scorched the back of the Huron, he would know where to\\nfind a woman to feel the smart. The daughter of Munro would draw his\\nwater, hoe his corn, and cook his venison. The body of the gray-head\\nwould sleep among his cannon, but his heart would lie within reach of\\nthe knife of Le Subtil.\"\\n\\n\"Monster! well dost thou deserve thy treacherous name!\" cried Cora, in\\nan ungovernable burst of filial indignation. \"None but a fiend could\\nmeditate such a vengeance! But thou overratest thy power! You shall find\\nit is, in truth, the heart of Munro you hold, and that it will defy your\\nutmost malice!\"\\n\\nThe Indian answered this bold defiance by a ghastly smile, that showed\\nan unaltered purpose, while he motioned her away, as if to close the\\nconference forever. Cora, already regretting her precipitation, was\\nobliged to comply, for Magua instantly left the spot, and approached his\\ngluttonous comrades. Heyward flew to the side of the agitated female,\\nand demanded the result of a dialogue that he had watched at a distance\\nwith so much interest. But unwilling to alarm the fears of Alice, she\\nevaded a direct reply, betraying only by her countenance her utter want\\nof success, and keeping her anxious looks fastened on the slightest\\nmovements of their captors. To the reiterated and earnest questions of\\nher sister, concerning their probable destination, she made no other\\nanswer than by pointing towards the dark group, with an agitation she\\ncould not control, and murmuring, as she folded Alice to her bosom--\\n\\n\"There, there; read our fortunes in their faces; we shall see; we shall\\nsee!\"\\n\\nThe action, and the choked utterance of Cora, spoke more impressively\\nthan any words, and quickly drew the attention of her companions on that\\nspot where her own was riveted with an intenseness that nothing but the\\nimportance of the stake could create.\\n\\nWhen Magua reached the cluster of lolling savages, who, gorged with\\ntheir disgusting meal, lay stretched on the earth in brutal indulgence,\\nhe commenced speaking with the dignity of an Indian chief. The first\\nsyllables he uttered had the effect to cause his listeners to raise\\nthemselves in attitudes of respectful attention. As the Huron used his\\nnative language, the prisoners, notwithstanding the caution of the\\nnatives had kept them within the swing of their tomahawks, could only\\nconjecture the substance of his harrangue, from the nature of those\\nsignificant gestures with which an Indian always illustrates his\\neloquence.\\n\\nAt first, the language, as well as the action of Magua, appeared calm\\nand deliberate. When he had succeeded in sufficiently awakening the\\nattention of his comrades, Heyward fancied, by his pointing so\\nfrequently towards the direction of the great lakes, that he spoke of\\nthe land of their fathers, and of their distant tribe. Frequent\\nindications of applause escaped the listeners, who, as they uttered the\\nexpressive \"Hugh!\" looked at each other in commendation of the speaker.\\nLe Renard was too skilful to neglect his advantage. He now spoke of the\\nlong and painful route by which they had left those spacious grounds and\\nhappy villages, to come and battle against the enemies of their\\nCanadian fathers. He enumerated the warriors of the party; their\\nseveral merits; their frequent services to the nation; their wounds, and\\nthe number of the scalps they had taken. Whenever he alluded to any\\npresent (and the subtle Indian neglected none), the dark countenance of\\nthe flattered individual gleamed with exultation, nor did he even\\nhesitate to assert the truth of the words, by gestures of applause and\\nconfirmation. Then the voice of the speaker fell, and lost the loud,\\nanimated tones of triumph with which he had enumerated their deeds of\\nsuccess and victory. He described the cataract of Glenn\\'s; the\\nimpregnable position of its rocky island, with its caverns, and its\\nnumerous rapids and whirlpools; he named the name of La Longue Carabine,\\nand paused until the forest beneath them had sent up the last echo of a\\nloud and long yell, with which the hated appellation was received. He\\npointed towards the youthful military captive, and described the death\\nof a favorite warrior, who had been precipitated into the deep ravine by\\nhis hand. He not only mentioned the fate of him who, hanging between\\nheaven and earth, had presented such a spectacle of horror to the whole\\nband, but he acted anew the terrors of his situation, his resolution and\\nhis death, on the branches of a sapling; and, finally, he rapidly\\nrecounted the manner in which each of their friends had fallen, never\\nfailing to touch upon their courage, and their most acknowledged\\nvirtues. When this recital of events was ended, his voice once more\\nchanged, and became plaintive, and even musical, in its low guttural\\nsounds. He now spoke of the wives and children of the slain; their\\ndestitution; their misery, both physical and moral; their distance; and,\\nat last, of their unavenged wrongs. Then suddenly lifting his voice to a\\npitch of terrific energy, he concluded, by demanding,--\\n\\n\"Are the Hurons dogs to bear this? Who shall say to the wife of Menowgua\\nthat the fishes have his scalp, and that his nation have not taken\\nrevenge! Who will dare meet the mother of Wassawattimie, that scornful\\nwoman, with his hands clean! What shall be said to the old men when they\\nask us for scalps, and we have not a hair from a white head to give\\nthem! The women will point their fingers at us. There is a dark spot on\\nthe names of the Hurons, and it must be hid in blood!\"\\n\\nHis voice was no longer audible in the burst of rage which now broke\\ninto the air, as if the wood, instead of containing so small a band, was\\nfilled with the nation. During the foregoing address the progress of the\\nspeaker was too plainly read by those most interested in his success,\\nthrough the medium of the countenances of the men he addressed. They had\\nanswered his melancholy and mourning by sympathy and sorrow; his\\nassertions, by gestures of confirmation; and his boastings, with the\\nexultation of savages. When he spoke of courage, their looks were firm\\nand responsive; when he alluded to their injuries, their eyes kindled\\nwith fury; when he mentioned the taunts of the women, they dropped their\\nheads in shame; but when he pointed out their means of vengeance, he\\nstruck a chord which never failed to thrill in the breast of an Indian.\\nWith the first intimation that it was within their reach, the whole band\\nsprang upon their feet as one man; giving utterance to their rage in the\\nmost frantic cries, they rushed upon their prisoners in a body with\\ndrawn knives and uplifted tomahawks. Heyward threw himself between the\\nsisters and the foremost, whom he grappled with a desperate strength\\nthat for a moment checked his violence. This unexpected resistance gave\\nMagua time to interpose, and with rapid enunciation and animated\\ngesture, he drew the attention of the band again to himself. In that\\nlanguage he knew so well how to assume, he diverted his comrades from\\ntheir instant purpose, and invited them to prolong the misery of their\\nvictims. His proposal was received with acclamations, and executed with\\nthe swiftness of thought.\\n\\nTwo powerful warriors cast themselves on Heyward, while another was\\noccupied in securing the less active singing-master. Neither of the\\ncaptives, however, submitted without a desperate though fruitless\\nstruggle. Even David hurled his assailant to the earth; nor was Heyward\\nsecured until the victory over his companion enabled the Indians to\\ndirect their united force to that object. He was then bound and fastened\\nto the body of the sapling, on whose branches Magua had acted the\\npantomime of the falling Huron. When the young soldier regained his\\nrecollection, he had the painful certainty before his eyes that a common\\nfate was intended for the whole party. On his right was Cora, in a\\ndurance similar to his own, pale and agitated, but with an eye, whose\\nsteady look still read the proceedings of their enemies. On his left,\\nthe withes which bound her to a pine, performed that office for Alice\\nwhich her trembling limbs refused, and alone kept her fragile form from\\nsinking. Her hands were clasped before her in prayer, but instead of\\nlooking upwards towards that power which alone could rescue them, her\\nunconscious looks wandered to the countenance of Duncan with infantile\\ndependency. David had contended, and the novelty of the circumstance\\nheld him silent, in deliberation on the propriety of the unusual\\noccurrence.\\n\\nThe vengeance of the Hurons had now taken a new direction, and they\\nprepared to execute it with that barbarous ingenuity with which they\\nwere familiarized by the practice of centuries. Some sought knots, to\\nraise the blazing pile; one was riving the splinters of pine, in order\\nto pierce the flesh of their captives with the burning fragments; and\\nothers bent the tops of two saplings to the earth, in order to suspend\\nHeyward by the arms between the recoiling branches. But the vengeance of\\nMagua sought a deeper and a more malignant enjoyment.\\n\\nWhile the less refined monsters of the band prepared, before the eyes of\\nthose who were to suffer, these well known and vulgar means of torture,\\nhe approached Cora, and pointed out, with the most malign expression of\\ncountenance, the speedy fate that awaited her:--\\n\\n\"Ha!\" he added, \"what says the daughter of Munro? Her head is too good\\nto find a pillow in the wigwam of Le Renard; will she like it better\\nwhen it rolls about this hill a plaything for the wolves? Her bosom\\ncannot nurse the children of a Huron; she will see it spit upon by\\nIndians!\"\\n\\n\"What means the monster!\" demanded the astonished Heyward.\\n\\n\"Nothing!\" was the firm reply. \"He is a savage, a barbarous and ignorant\\nsavage, and knows not what he does. Let us find leisure, with our dying\\nbreath, to ask for him penitence and pardon.\"\\n\\n\"Pardon!\" echoed the fierce Huron, mistaking, in his anger, the meaning\\nof her words; \"the memory of an Indian is longer than the arm of the\\npale-faces; his mercy shorter than their justice! Say; shall I send the\\nyellow hair to her father, and will you follow Magua to the great lakes,\\nto carry his water, and feed him with corn?\"\\n\\nCora beckoned him away, with an emotion of disgust she could not\\ncontrol.\\n\\n\"Leave me,\" she said, with a solemnity that for a moment checked the\\nbarbarity of the Indian; \"you mingle bitterness in my prayers; you stand\\nbetween me and my God!\"\\n\\nThe slight impression produced on the savage was, however, soon\\nforgotten, and he continued pointing, with taunting irony, towards\\nAlice.\\n\\n\"Look! the child weeps! She is young to die! Send her to Munro, to comb\\nhis gray hairs, and keep life in the heart of the old man.\"\\n\\nCora could not resist the desire to look upon her youthful sister, in\\nwhose eyes she met an imploring glance, that betrayed the longings of\\nnature.\\n\\n\"What says he, dearest Cora?\" asked the trembling voice of Alice. \"Did\\nhe speak of sending me to our father?\"\\n\\nFor many moments the elder sister looked upon the younger, with a\\ncountenance that wavered with powerful and contending emotions. At\\nlength she spoke, though her tones had lost their rich and calm fulness,\\nin an expression of tenderness that seemed maternal.\\n\\n\"Alice,\" she said, \"the Huron offers us both life, nay, more than both;\\nhe offers to restore Duncan, our invaluable Duncan, as well as you, to\\nour friends--to our father--to our heart-stricken, childless father, if\\nI will bow down this rebellious, stubborn pride of mine, and consent--\"\\n\\nHer voice became choked, and clasping her hands, she looked upward, as\\nif seeking, in her agony, intelligence from a wisdom that was infinite.\\n\\n\"Say on,\" cried Alice; \"to what, dearest Cora? O, that the proffer were\\nmade to me! to save you, to cheer our aged father, to restore Duncan,\\nhow cheerfully could I die!\"\\n\\n\"Die!\" repeated Cora, with a calmer and a firmer voice, \"that were easy!\\nPerhaps the alternative may not be less so. He would have me,\" she\\ncontinued, her accents sinking under a deep consciousness of the\\ndegradation of the proposal, \"follow him to the wilderness; go to the\\nhabitations of the Hurons; to remain there: in short to become his wife!\\nSpeak, then, Alice; child of my affections! sister of my love! And you,\\ntoo, Major Heyward, aid my weak reason with your counsel. Is life to be\\npurchased by such a sacrifice? Will you, Alice, receive it at my hands\\nat such a price? And _you_, Duncan, guide me; control me between you;\\nfor I am wholly yours.\"\\n\\n\"Would I!\" echoed the indignant and astonished youth. \"Cora! Cora! you\\njest with our misery! Name not the horrid alternative again; the thought\\nitself is worse than a thousand deaths.\"\\n\\n\"That such would be _your_ answer, I well knew!\" exclaimed Cora, her\\ncheeks flushing, and her dark eyes once more sparkling with the\\nlingering emotions of a woman. \"What says my Alice? for her will I\\nsubmit without another murmur.\"\\n\\nAlthough both Heyward and Cora listened with painful suspense and the\\ndeepest attention, no sounds were heard in reply. It appeared as if the\\ndelicate and sensitive form of Alice would shrink into itself, as she\\nlistened to this proposal. Her arms had fallen lengthwise before her,\\nthe fingers moving in slight convulsions; her head dropped upon her\\nbosom, and her whole person seemed suspended against the tree, looking\\nlike some beautiful emblem of the wounded delicacy of her sex, devoid of\\nanimation, and yet keenly conscious. In a few moments, however, her head\\nbegan to move slowly, in a sign of deep, unconquerable disapprobation.\\n\\n\"No, no, no; better that we die as we have lived, together!\"\\n\\n\"Then die!\" shouted Magua, hurling his tomahawk with violence at the\\nunresisting speaker, and gnashing his teeth with a rage that could no\\nlonger be bridled, at this sudden exhibition of firmness in the one he\\nbelieved the weakest of the party. The axe cleaved the air in front of\\nHeyward, and cutting some of the flowing ringlets of Alice, quivered in\\nthe tree above her head. The sight maddened Duncan to desperation.\\nCollecting all his energies in one effort, he snapped the twigs which\\nbound him and rushed upon another savage who was preparing with loud\\nyells, and a more deliberate aim, to repeat the blow. They encountered,\\ngrappled, and fell to the earth together. The naked body of his\\nantagonist afforded Heyward no means of holding his adversary, who\\nglided from his grasp, and rose again with one knee on his chest,\\npressing him down with the weight of a giant. Duncan already saw the\\nknife gleaming in the air, when a whistling sound swept past him, and\\nwas rather accompanied, than followed, by the sharp crack of a rifle. He\\nfelt his breast relieved from the load it had endured; he saw the savage\\nexpression of his adversary\\'s countenance change to a look of vacant\\nwildness, when the Indian fell dead on the faded leaves by his side.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "    'summary_text': 'Though at first menaced by the Hurons, Heyward is held for questioning, but he has to turn for interpretation to Magua, whom he sees Hawkeye had wounded on the shoulder. When he finally convinces them that the three woodsmen have escaped, they are furious, and one savage grabs Alice by the hair in a mock scalping. Before real violence can occur, the chief calls a brief council and the entire party crosses to the south bank of the river where the horses are. Mounted on Heyward\\'s charger, the chief leads most of his people away across river, leaving the prisoners in charge of six Indians headed by Magua. The major tries to secure Magua\\'s help by privately implying that he and the redskin have been in collusion to fool the Hurons all along and by offering rewards. Although Heyward adopts the sententious speech of the Indians, Magua is noncommittal as the group heads south, the sisters mounted and the others afoot. Flanked by the Indians, Cora finds it difficult to leave signs on the trail; once when she drops a glove, she is detected and severely warned by one of their conductors. Never speaking, Magua steadily leads the way through the forests and hills until they finally reach a steep, pyramidal hill with a level summit and few trees -- a perfect place for defense and for avoiding surprise. While the warriors eat the raw meat of a fawn, Heyward again engages Magua in talk. Heyward\\'s expression of Munro\\'s love for his daughters brings a gleam of malignant joy to the Indian\\'s face, and the latter insists upon a private talk with Cora. He proudly tells her that he was born a chief but that, after the Canadians taught him to drink firewater, he was driven from his tribe. Once when working for Munro, he came into Munro\\'s cabin drunk and the latter had him tied up and whipped like a dog before the soldiers. He demands, is it \"justice to make evil, and then punish for it?\" Wanting injury for injury, he says he will let Alice go if Cora will come with him as his wife: \"The body of the gray-head would sleep among his cannon, but his heart would lie within reach of the knife of Le Subtil.\" Cora is indignant and returns to her fellow captives. Magua goes to the lolling savages and begins a skillful harangue, building their emotions to the point of rage and vengeance. As they rush upon their prisoners with drawn knives and uplifted tomahawks, Magua villainously invites them to prolong the victims\\' misery. Heyward and Gamut struggle to no avail, and all four are tied to saplings while splinters and fire are prepared for the torture. Magua again makes his proposal, and Cora leaves the decision to Alice, who hesitates in her weakness but finally says no. Gnashing his teeth, the Huron hurls his tomahawk just above Alice\\'s head, cutting some of her ringlets. Maddened, Heyward snaps his bonds and rushes upon another Indian who is about to throw his weapon. In the struggle, Heyward goes down and the Indian raises his knife fatally. But the crack of a rifle is heard, and the Indian\\'s look changes to vacant wildness as he falls dead on the faded leaves beside Heyward.',\n",
       "    'summary_analysis': 'These chapters are important for certain revelations and one presentation of status quo ante . The latter comes in Magua\\'s explaining his past; his noble birth and his deserved but ignoble treatment by Munro do not justify his present actions, but they do make him and his conduct believable. They also raise the questions of justice and the big context of shared responsibility. The revelations begin with Heyward\\'s learning of the fame of his two former Indian companions, Chingachgook as \"Le Gros Serpent\"  and Uncas as \"Le Cerf Agile\" . Magua makes clear not only his motives but also the alternative routes that he will let his vengeance take. Perhaps the most important is Gamut\\'s self-revelation when he struggles hand-to-hand with his captors: \"David had contended, and the novelty of the circumstance held him silent.\" The realities of frontier strife are beginning to impinge upon him. Two influences on Cooper\\'s fiction are also apparent. Indian lore comes forth in the figurative language of the natives, in the masterful and persuasive oratory of Magua, in the Hurons\\' contrasting silent patience and loud bloodthirstiness, and in methods of torture such as tying a man\\'s arms to the tops of two bent saplings that will recoil in different directions. Sentimental qualities appear in the reactions of the fragile Alice, in the extreme testing of Cora\\'s virtue and familial emotions, and in Heyward\\'s over-vocalized sense of duty and honor. Holding together all of these fictional elements is the plot device of the chase, through which a reversal of fortunes has occurred. Some of the pursued and some of the pursuers have exchanged their roles, while some have had relative security usurped by imminent danger and vice versa.',\n",

He and the Mohicans advance to hand-to-hand combat, Uncas jumping protectively in front of Cora and saving her a moment later by killing an Indian whose tomahawk has cut her bonds. Soon all the Hurons are dead except Magua, who is fighting with Chingachgook. The villain feigns death and escapes before Hawkeye can brain him with the butt of his rifle. Chingachgook scalps the dead while Uncas and Heyward assist the females and Hawkeye releases Gamut. The scout advises the singing master to give up his \\\\\"little tooting instrument\\\\\" for a useful weapon, and Gamut counters by arguing the fatality of Calvinistic doctrine found in books. Completely the practical man, Hawkeye disdainfully says that the only book worth reading is nature. Gamut\\'s response is to sing a song, but Hawkeye common-sensically reloads his rifle and sees that everyone is armed. Then they start their journey with the girls riding the Narragansets. They very shortly stop and clear the leaves and clay from a hidden mineral spring, and Hawkeye tells how the three of them, sagaciously aided by Uncas, had tracked the Hurons for twenty miles. After a simple cooked meal, they proceed towards the north where Fort William Henry lies.\", \"analysis\": \"This is another bloody chapter, but its thematic significance is in the views of Gamut and Hawkeye. At first the psalmodist seems to have learned nothing from his recent experiences, yet it is notable that, whereas before he has done little more than sing and mouth religious platitudes, he now turns to doctrine and argument as if he must go deeper into his beliefs to convince Hawkeye and perhaps himself. Although in this instance the Yankee\\'s singing is a retreat as the scout gets the better of the discussion, Cooper gives Gamut his due as a folklore figure, \\\\\"a minstrel of the western continent . . . after the spirit of his own age and country.\\\\\" Hawkeye says that the recent action \\\\\"was all foreordered, and for the best.\\\\\" But he will admit such only after events have actually occurred, not beforehand as Gamut\\'s Calvinistic predestination insists upon. As something of a deist, he reads God in nature: \\\\\"I know not but man may so deform his works in the settlement, as to leave that which is so clear in the wilderness a matter of doubt among traders and priests.\\\\\" A few minutes later talking about the unusual way the Narragansets have been trained to walk, he comments that \\\\\"natur\\' is sadly abused by man, when he once gets the mastery.\\\\\" His point is that people should not seek absolute mastery and try to rival God. Highly pragmatic, he finds that the greatest lesson taught by nature is humility. He is the noble, self-outcast frontiersman who has turned his back on the settlement to seek, as a thinking man, the freedom and simplicity of natural morality; and he prefers this even though  it entails danger and killing. Since Cooper is developing some interest between Uncas and Cora, just before mid-chapter he carefully presents Uncas as showing \\\\\"a sympathy that elevated him far above the intelligence, and advanced him probably centuries before the practices of his nation.\\\\\" Though he will not fully allow it later, Cooper is presently trying to make their mutual interest acceptable and believable.\"}',\n",
       "    'chapter': '\\n  \"_Clo._--I am gone, sir,\\n      And anon, sir,\\n  I\\'ll be with you again.\"\\n\\n  _Twelfth Night._\\n\\n\\nThe Hurons stood aghast at this sudden visitation of death on one of\\ntheir band. But, as they regarded the fatal accuracy of an aim which had\\ndared to immolate an enemy at so much hazard to a friend, the name of\\n\"La Longue Carabine\" burst simultaneously from every lip, and was\\nsucceeded by a wild and a sort of plaintive howl. The cry was answered\\nby a loud shout from a little thicket, where the incautious party had\\npiled their arms; and at the next moment, Hawkeye, too eager to load the\\nrifle he had regained, was seen advancing upon them, brandishing the\\nclubbed weapon, and cutting the air with wide and powerful sweeps. Bold\\nand rapid as was the progress of the scout, it was exceeded by that of a\\nlight and vigorous form which, bounding past him, leaped, with\\nincredible activity and daring, into the very centre of the Hurons,\\nwhere it stood, whirling a tomahawk, and flourishing a glittering knife,\\nwith fearful menaces, in front of Cora. Quicker than the thoughts could\\nfollow these unexpected and audacious movements, an image, armed in the\\nemblematic panoply of death, glided before their eyes, and assumed a\\nthreatening attitude at the other\\'s side. The savage tormentors recoiled\\nbefore these warlike intruders, and uttered as they appeared in such\\nquick succession, the often repeated and peculiar exclamation of\\nsurprise, followed by the well known and dreaded appellations of--\\n\\n\"Le Cerf Agile! Le Gros Serpent!\"\\n\\nBut the wary and vigilant leader of the Hurons was not so easily\\ndisconcerted. Casting his keen eyes around the little plain, he\\ncomprehended the nature of the assault at a glance, and encouraging his\\nfollowers by his voice as well as by his example, he unsheathed his long\\nand dangerous knife, and rushed with a loud whoop upon the expecting\\nChingachgook. It was the signal for a general combat. Neither party had\\nfire-arms, and the contest was to be decided in the deadliest manner;\\nhand to hand, with weapons of offence, and none of defence.\\n\\nUncas answered the whoop, and leaping on an enemy, with a single, well\\ndirected blow of his tomahawk, cleft him to the brain. Heyward tore the\\nweapon of Magua from the sapling, and rushed eagerly towards the fray.\\nAs the combatants were now equal in number, each singled an opponent\\nfrom the adverse band. The rush and blows passed with the fury of a\\nwhirlwind, and the swiftness of lightning. Hawkeye soon got another\\nenemy within reach of his arm, and with one sweep of his formidable\\nweapon he beat down the slight and inartificial defences of his\\nantagonist, crushing him to the earth with the blow. Heyward ventured to\\nhurl the tomahawk he had seized, too ardent to await the moment of\\nclosing. It struck the Indian he had selected on the forehead, and\\nchecked for an instant his onward rush. Encouraged by this slight\\nadvantage, the impetuous young man continued his onset, and sprang upon\\nhis enemy with naked hands. A single instant was enough to assure him of\\nthe rashness of the measure, for he immediately found himself fully\\nengaged, with all his activity and courage, in endeavoring to ward the\\ndesperate thrusts made with the knife of the Huron. Unable longer to\\nfoil an enemy so alert and vigilant, he threw his arms about him, and\\nsucceeded in pinning the limbs of the other to his side, with an iron\\ngrasp, but one that was far too exhausting to himself to continue long.\\nIn this extremity he heard a voice near him, shouting--\\n\\n\"Extarminate the varlets! no quarter to an accursed Mingo!\"\\n\\nAt the next moment, the breech of Hawkeye\\'s rifle fell on the naked head\\nof his adversary, whose muscles appeared to wither under the shock, as\\nhe sank from the arms of Duncan, flexible and motionless.\\n\\nWhen Uncas had brained his first antagonist, he turned, like a hungry\\nlion, to seek another. The fifth and only Huron disengaged at the first\\nonset had paused a moment, and then seeing that all around him were\\nemployed in the deadly strife, he sought, with hellish vengeance, to\\ncomplete the baffled work of revenge. Raising a shout of triumph, he\\nsprang towards the defenceless Cora, sending his keen axe, as the\\ndreadful precursor of his approach. The tomahawk grazed her shoulder,\\nand cutting the withes which bound her to the tree, left the maiden at\\nliberty to fly. She eluded the grasp of the savage, and reckless of her\\nown safety, threw herself on the bosom of Alice, striving with\\nconvulsed and ill-directed fingers, to tear asunder the twigs which\\nconfined the person of her sister. Any other than a monster would have\\nrelented at such an act of generous devotion to the best and purest\\naffection; but the breast of the Huron was a stranger to sympathy.\\nSeizing Cora by the rich tresses which fell in confusion about her form,\\nhe tore her from her frantic hold, and bowed her down with brutal\\nviolence to her knees. The savage drew the flowing curls through his\\nhand, and raising them on high with an outstretched arm, he passed the\\nknife around the exquisitely moulded head of his victim, with a taunting\\nand exulting laugh. But he purchased this moment of fierce gratification\\nwith the loss of the fatal opportunity. It was just then the sight\\ncaught the eye of Uncas. Bounding from his footsteps he appeared for an\\ninstant darting through the air, and descending in a ball he fell on the\\nchest of his enemy, driving him many yards from the spot, headlong and\\nprostrate. The violence of the exertion cast the young Mohican at his\\nside. They arose together, fought, and bled, each in his turn. But the\\nconflict was soon decided; the tomahawk of Heyward and the rifle of\\nHawkeye descended on the skull of the Huron, at the same moment that the\\nknife of Uncas reached his heart.\\n\\nThe battle was now entirely terminated, with the exception of the\\nprotracted struggle between Le Renard Subtil and Le Gros Serpent. Well\\ndid these barbarous warriors prove that they deserved those significant\\nnames which had been bestowed for deeds in former wars. When they\\nengaged, some little time was lost in eluding the quick and vigorous\\nthrusts which had been aimed at their lives. Suddenly darting on each\\nother, they closed, and came to the earth, twisted together like twining\\nserpents, in pliant and subtle folds. At the moment when the victors\\nfound themselves unoccupied, the spot where these experienced and\\ndesperate combatants lay, could only be distinguished by a cloud of dust\\nand leaves which moved from the centre of the little plain towards its\\nboundary, as if raised by the passage of a whirlwind. Urged by the\\ndifferent motives of filial affection, friendship, and gratitude,\\nHeyward and his companions rushed with one accord to the place,\\nencircling the little canopy of dust which hung above the warriors. In\\nvain did Uncas dart around the cloud, with a wish to strike his knife\\ninto the heart of his father\\'s foe; the threatening rifle of Hawkeye was\\nraised and suspended in vain, while Duncan endeavored to seize the\\nlimbs of the Huron with hands that appeared to have lost their power.\\nCovered, as they were, with dust and blood, the swift evolutions of the\\ncombatants seemed to incorporate their bodies into one. The death-like\\nlooking figure of the Mohican, and the dark form of the Huron, gleamed\\nbefore their eyes in such quick and confused succession, that the\\nfriends of the former knew not where nor when to plant the succoring\\nblow. It is true there were short and fleeting moments, when the fiery\\neyes of Magua were seen glittering, like the fabled organs of the\\nbasilisk, through the dusty wreath by which he was enveloped, and he\\nread by those short and deadly glances the fate of the combat in the\\npresence of his enemies; ere, however, any hostile hand could descend on\\nhis devoted head, its place was filled by the scowling visage of\\nChingachgook. In this manner the scene of the combat was removed from\\nthe centre of the little plain to its verge. The Mohican now found an\\nopportunity to make a powerful thrust with his knife; Magua suddenly\\nrelinquished his grasp, and fell backward without motion, and seemingly\\nwithout life. His adversary leaped on his feet, making the arches of the\\nforest ring with the sounds of triumph.\\n\\n\"Well done for the Delawares! victory to the Mohican!\" cried Hawkeye,\\nonce more elevating the butt of the long and fatal rifle; \"a finishing\\nblow from a man without a cross will never tell against his honor, nor\\nrob him of his right to the scalp.\"\\n\\nBut, at the very moment when the dangerous weapon was in the act of\\ndescending, the subtle Huron rolled swiftly from beneath the danger,\\nover the edge of the precipice, and falling on his feet, was seen\\nleaping, with a single bound, into the centre of a thicket of low\\nbushes, which clung along its sides. The Delawares, who had believed\\ntheir enemy dead, uttered their exclamation of surprise, and were\\nfollowing with speed and clamor, like hounds in open view of the deer,\\nwhen a shrill and peculiar cry from the scout instantly changed their\\npurpose, and recalled them to the summit of the hill.\\n\\n\"\\'Twas like himself,\" cried the inveterate forester, whose prejudices\\ncontributed so largely to veil his natural sense of justice in all\\nmatters which concerned the Mingos; \"a lying and deceitful varlet as he\\nis. An honest Delaware now, being fairly vanquished, would have lain\\nstill, and been knocked on the head, but these knavish Maquas cling to\\nlife like so many cats-o\\'-the-mountain. Let him go--let him go; \\'tis but\\none man, and he without rifle or bow, many a long mile from his French\\ncommerades; and, like a rattler that has lost his fangs, he can do no\\nfurther mischief, until such time as he, and we too, may leave the\\nprints of our moccasins over a long reach of sandy plain. See, Uncas,\"\\nhe added, in Delaware, \"your father is flaying the scalps already. It\\nmay be well to go round and feel the vagabonds that are left, or we may\\nhave another of them loping through the woods, and screeching like a jay\\nthat has been winged.\"\\n\\n[Illustration: _Copyright by Charles Scribner\\'s Sons_\\n\\nTHE FIGHT IN THE FOREST\\n\\n_The battle was now entirely terminated, with the exception of the\\nprotracted struggle between Le Renard Subtil and Le Gros Serpent_]\\n\\nSo saying, the honest, but implacable scout, made the circuit of the\\ndead, into whose senseless bosoms he thrust his long knife, with as much\\ncoolness as though they had been so many brute carcasses. He had,\\nhowever, been anticipated by the elder Mohican, who had already torn the\\nemblems of victory from the unresisting heads of the slain.\\n\\nBut Uncas, denying his habits, we had almost said his nature, flew with\\ninstinctive delicacy, accompanied by Heyward, to the assistance of the\\nfemales, and quickly releasing Alice, placed her in the arms of Cora. We\\nshall not attempt to describe the gratitude to the Almighty Disposer of\\nevents which glowed in the bosoms of the sisters, who were thus\\nunexpectedly restored to life and to each other. Their thanksgivings\\nwere deep and silent; the offerings of their gentle spirits, burning\\nbrightest and purest on the secret altars of their hearts; and their\\nrenovated and more earthly feelings exhibiting themselves in long and\\nfervent, though speechless caresses. As Alice rose from her knees, where\\nshe had sunk by the side of Cora, she threw herself on the bosom of the\\nlatter; and sobbed aloud the name of their aged father, while her soft,\\ndove-like eyes sparkled with the rays of hope.\\n\\n\"We are saved! we are saved!\" she murmured; \"to return to the arms of\\nour dear, dear father, and his heart will not be broken with grief. And\\nyou too, Cora, my sister; my more than sister, my mother; you too are\\nspared. And Duncan,\" she added, looking round upon the youth with a\\nsmile of ineffable innocence, \"even our own brave and noble Duncan has\\nescaped without a hurt.\"\\n\\nTo these ardent and nearly incoherent words Cora made no other answer\\nthan by straining the youthful speaker to her heart, as she bent over\\nher, in melting tenderness. The manhood of Heyward felt no shame in\\ndropping tears over this spectacle of affectionate rapture; and Uncas\\nstood, fresh and blood-stained from the combat, a calm, and, apparently,\\nan unmoved looker-on, it is true, but with eyes that had already lost\\ntheir fierceness, and were beaming with a sympathy that elevated him far\\nabove the intelligence, and advanced him probably centuries before the\\npractices of his nation.\\n\\nDuring this display of emotions so natural in their situation, Hawkeye,\\nwhose vigilant distrust had satisfied itself that the Hurons, who\\ndisfigured the heavenly scene, no longer possessed the power to\\ninterrupt its harmony, approached David, and liberated him from the\\nbonds he had, until that moment, endured with the most exemplary\\npatience.\\n\\n\"There,\" exclaimed the scout, casting the last withe behind him, \"you\\nare once more master of your own limbs, though you seem not to use them\\nwith greater judgment than that in which they were first fashioned. If\\nadvice from one who is not older than yourself, but who having lived\\nmost of his time in the wilderness, may be said to have experience\\nbeyond his years, will give no offence, you are welcome to my thoughts;\\nand these are, to part with the little tooting instrument in your jacket\\nto the first fool you meet with, and buy some useful we\\'pon with the\\nmoney, if it be only the barrel of a horseman\\'s pistol. By industry and\\ncare, you might thus come to some prefarment; for by this time, I should\\nthink, your eyes would plainly tell you that a carrion crow is a better\\nbird than a mocking thresher. The one will, at least, remove foul sights\\nfrom before the face of man, while the other is only good to brew\\ndisturbances in the woods, by cheating the ears of all that hear them.\"\\n\\n\"Arms and the clarion for the battle, but the song of thanksgiving to\\nthe victory!\" answered the liberated David. \"Friend,\" he added,\\nthrusting forth his lean, delicate hand towards Hawkeye, in kindness,\\nwhile his eyes twinkled and grew moist, \"I thank thee that the hairs of\\nmy head still grow where they were first rooted by Providence; for,\\nthough those of other men may be more glossy and curling, I have ever\\nfound mine own well suited to the brain they shelter. That I did not\\njoin myself to the battle, was less owing to disinclination, than to the\\nbonds of the heathen. Valiant and skilful hast thou proved thyself in\\nthe conflict, and I hereby thank thee, before proceeding to discharge\\nother and more important duties, because thou hast proved thyself well\\nworthy of a Christian\\'s praise.\"\\n\\n\"The thing is but a trifle, and what you may often see, if you tarry\\nlong among us,\" returned the scout, a good deal softened towards the\\nman of song, by this unequivocal expression of gratitude. \"I have got\\nback my old companion, \\'Killdeer,\\'\" he added, striking his hand on the\\nbreech of his rifle; \"and that in itself is a victory. These Iroquois\\nare cunning, but they outwitted themselves when they placed their\\nfire-arms out of reach; and had Uncas or his father been gifted with\\nonly their common Indian patience, we should have come in upon the\\nknaves with three bullets instead of one, and that would have made a\\nfinish of the whole pack; yon loping varlet, as well as his commerades.\\nBut \\'twas all foreordered, and for the best.\"\\n\\n\"Thou sayest well,\" returned David, \"and hast caught the true spirit of\\nChristianity. He that is to be saved will be saved, and he that is\\npredestined to be damned will be damned. This is the doctrine of truth,\\nand most consoling and refreshing it is to the true believer.\"\\n\\nThe scout, who by this time was seated, examining into the state of his\\nrifle with a species of parental assiduity, now looked up at the other\\nin a displeasure that he did not affect to conceal, roughly interrupting\\nfurther speech.\\n\\n\"Doctrine, or no doctrine,\" said the sturdy woodsman, \"\\'tis the belief\\nof knaves, and the curse of an honest man. I can credit that yonder\\nHuron was to fall by my hand, for with my own eyes I have seen it; but\\nnothing short of being a witness will cause me to think he had met with\\nany reward, or that Chingachgook, there, will be condemned at the final\\nday.\"\\n\\n\"You have no warranty for such an audacious doctrine, nor any covenant\\nto support it,\" cried David, who was deeply tinctured with the subtle\\ndistinctions which, in his time, and more especially in his province,\\nhad been drawn around the beautiful simplicity of revelation, by\\nendeavoring to penetrate the awful mystery of the divine nature,\\nsupplying faith by self-sufficiency, and by consequence, involving those\\nwho reasoned from such human dogmas in absurdities and doubt; \"your\\ntemple is reared on the sands, and the first tempest will wash away its\\nfoundation. I demand your authorities for such an uncharitable assertion\\n(like other advocates of a system, David was not always accurate in his\\nuse of terms). Name chapter and verse; in which of the holy books do you\\nfind language to support you?\"\\n\\n\"Book!\" repeated Hawkeye, with singular and ill-concealed disdain; \"do\\nyou take me for a whimpering boy at the apron-string of one of your old\\ngals; and this good rifle on my knee for the feather of a goose\\'s wing,\\nmy ox\\'s horn for a bottle of ink, and my leathern pouch for a\\ncross-barred handkercher to carry my dinner? Book! what have such as I,\\nwho am a warrior of the wilderness, though a man without a cross, to do\\nwith books? I never read but in one, and the words that are written\\nthere are too simple and too plain to need much schooling; though I may\\nboast that of forty long and hard-working years.\"\\n\\n\"What call you the volume?\" said David, misconceiving the other\\'s\\nmeaning.\\n\\n\"Tis open before your eyes,\" returned the scout; \"and he who owns it is\\nnot a niggard of its use. I have heard it said that there are men who\\nread in books to convince themselves there is a God. I know not but man\\nmay so deform his works in the settlement, as to leave that which is so\\nclear in the wilderness a matter of doubt among traders and priests. If\\nany such there be, and he will follow me from sun to sun, through the\\nwindings of the forest, he shall see enough to teach him that he is a\\nfool, and that the greatest of his folly lies in striving to rise to the\\nlevel of One he can never equal, be it in goodness, or be it in power.\"\\n\\nThe instant David discovered that he battled with a disputant who\\nimbibed his faith from the lights of nature, eschewing all subtleties of\\ndoctrine, he willingly abandoned a controversy from which he believed\\nneither profit nor credit was to be derived. While the scout was\\nspeaking, he had also seated himself, and producing the ready little\\nvolume and the iron-rimmed spectacles, he prepared to discharge a duty,\\nwhich nothing but the unexpected assault he had received in his\\northodoxy could have so long suspended. He was, in truth, a minstrel of\\nthe western continent--of a much later day, certainly, than those gifted\\nbards, who formerly sang the profane renown of baron and prince, but\\nafter the spirit of his own age and country; and he was now prepared to\\nexercise the cunning of his craft, in celebration of, or rather in\\nthanksgiving for, the recent victory. He waited patiently for Hawkeye to\\ncease, then lifting his eyes, together with his voice, he said, aloud,--\\n\\n\"I invite you, friends, to join in praise for this signal deliverance\\nfrom the hands of barbarians and infidels, to the comfortable and solemn\\ntones of the tune, called \\'Northampton.\\'\"\\n\\nHe next named the page and verse where the rhymes selected were to be\\nfound, and applied the pitch-pipe to his lips, with the decent gravity\\nthat he had been wont to use in the temple. This time he was, however,\\nwithout any accompaniment, for the sisters were just then pouring out\\nthose tender effusions of affection which have been already alluded to.\\nNothing deterred by the smallness of his audience, which, in truth,\\nconsisted only of the discontented scout, he raised his voice,\\ncommencing and ending the sacred song without accident or interruption\\nof any kind.\\n\\nHawkeye listened, while he coolly adjusted his flint and reloaded his\\nrifle; but the sounds, wanting the extraneous assistance of scene and\\nsympathy, failed to awaken his slumbering emotions. Never minstrel, or\\nby whatever more suitable name David should be known, drew upon his\\ntalents in the presence of more insensible auditors; though considering\\nthe singleness and sincerity of his motive, it is probable that no bard\\nof profane song ever uttered notes that ascended so near to that throne\\nwhere all homage and praise is due. The scout shook his head, and\\nmuttering some unintelligible words, among which \"throat\" and\\n\"Iroquois,\" were alone audible, he walked away, to collect, and to\\nexamine into, the state of the captured arsenal of the Hurons. In this\\noffice he was now joined by Chingachgook, who found his own, as well as\\nthe rifle of his son, among the arms. Even Heyward and David were\\nfurnished with weapons; nor was ammunition wanting to render them all\\neffectual.\\n\\nWhen the foresters had made their selection, and distributed their\\nprizes, the scout announced that the hour had arrived when it was\\nnecessary to move. By this time the song of Gamut had ceased, and the\\nsisters had learned to still the exhibition of their emotions. Aided by\\nDuncan and the younger Mohican, the two latter descended the precipitous\\nsides of that hill which they had so lately ascended under so very\\ndifferent auspices, and whose summit had so nearly proved the scene of\\ntheir massacre. At the foot, they found the Narragansetts browsing the\\nherbage of the bushes; and having mounted, they followed the movements\\nof a guide, who, in the most deadly straits, had so often proved himself\\ntheir friend. The journey was, however, short. Hawkeye, leaving the\\nblind path that the Hurons had followed, turned short to his right, and\\nentering the thicket, he crossed a babbling brook, and halted in a\\nnarrow dell, under the shade of a few water elms. Their distance from\\nthe base of the fatal hill was but a few rods, and the steeds had been\\nserviceable only in crossing the shallow stream.\\n\\nThe scout and the Indians appeared to be familiar with the sequestered\\nplace where they now were; for, leaning their rifles against the trees,\\nthey commenced throwing aside the dried leaves, and opening the blue\\nclay, out of which a clear and sparkling spring of bright, glancing\\nwater, quickly bubbled. The white man then looked about him, as though\\nseeking for some object, which was not to be found as readily as he\\nexpected:--\\n\\n\"Them careless imps, the Mohawks, with their Tuscarora and Onondaga\\nbrethren, have been here slaking their thirst,\" he muttered, \"and the\\nvagabonds have thrown away the gourd! This is the way with benefits,\\nwhen they are bestowed on such disremembering hounds! Here has the Lord\\nlaid his hand, in the midst of the howling wilderness, for their good,\\nand raised a fountain of water from the bowels of the \\'arth, that might\\nlaugh at the richest shop of apothecary\\'s ware in all the colonies; and\\nsee! the knaves have trodden in the clay, and deformed the cleanliness\\nof the place, as though they were brute beasts, instead of human men.\"\\n\\nUncas silently extended towards him the desired gourd, which the spleen\\nof Hawkeye had hitherto prevented him from observing, on a branch of an\\nelm. Filling it with water, he retired a short distance, to a place\\nwhere the ground was more firm and dry; here he coolly seated himself,\\nand after taking a long, and, apparently, a grateful draught, he\\ncommenced a very strict examination of the fragments of food left by the\\nHurons, which had hung in a wallet on his arm.\\n\\n\"Thank you, lad!\" he continued, returning the empty gourd to Uncas; \"now\\nwe will see how these rampaging Hurons lived, when outlying in\\nambushments. Look at this! The varlets know the better pieces of the\\ndeer; and one would think they might carve and roast a saddle, equal to\\nthe best cook in the land! But everything is raw, for the Iroquois are\\nthorough savages. Uncas, take my steel, and kindle a fire; a mouthful of\\na tender broil will give natur\\' a helping hand, after so long a trail.\"\\n\\nHeyward, perceiving that their guides now set about their repast in\\nsober earnest, assisted the ladies to alight, and placed himself at\\ntheir side, not unwilling to enjoy a few moments of grateful rest, after\\nthe bloody scene he had just gone through. While the culinary process\\nwas in hand, curiosity induced him to inquire into the circumstances\\nwhich had led to their timely and unexpected rescue:--\\n\\n\"How is it that we see you so soon, my generous friend,\" he asked, \"and\\nwithout aid from the garrison of Edward?\"\\n\\n\"Had we gone to the bend in the river, we might have been in time to\\nrake the leaves over your bodies, but too late to have saved your\\nscalps,\" coolly answered the scout. \"No, no; instead of throwing away\\nstrength and opportunity by crossing to the fort, we lay by, under the\\nbank of the Hudson, waiting to watch the movements of the Hurons.\"\\n\\n\"You were, then, witnesses of all that passed?\"\\n\\n\"Not of all; for Indian sight is too keen to be easily cheated, and we\\nkept close. A difficult matter it was, too, to keep this Mohican boy\\nsnug in the ambushment. Ah! Uncas, Uncas, your behavior was more like\\nthat of a curious woman than of a warrior on his scent.\"\\n\\nUncas permitted his eyes to turn for an instant on the sturdy\\ncountenance of the speaker, but he neither spoke nor gave any indication\\nof repentance. On the contrary, Heyward thought the manner of the young\\nMohican was disdainful, if not a little fierce, and that he suppressed\\npassions that were ready to explode, as much in compliment to the\\nlisteners, as from the deference he usually paid to his white associate.\\n\\n\"You saw our capture?\" Heyward next demanded.\\n\\n\"We heard it,\" was the significant answer. \"An Indian yell is plain\\nlanguage to men who have passed their days in the woods. But when you\\nlanded, we were driven to crawl, like sarpents, beneath the leaves; and\\nthen we lost sight of you entirely, until we placed eyes on you again,\\ntrussed to the trees, and ready bound for an Indian massacre.\"\\n\\n\"Our rescue was the deed of Providence. It was nearly a miracle that you\\ndid not mistake the path, for the Hurons divided, and each band had its\\nhorses.\"\\n\\n\"Ay! there we were thrown off the scent, and might, indeed, have lost\\nthe trail, had it not been for Uncas; we took the path, however, that\\nled into the wilderness; for we judged, and judged rightly, that the\\nsavages would hold that course with their prisoners. But when we had\\nfollowed it for many miles, without finding a single twig broken, as I\\nhad advised, my mind misgave me; especially as all the footsteps had the\\nprints of moccasins.\"\\n\\n\"Our captors had the precaution to see us shod like themselves,\" said\\nDuncan, raising a foot, and exhibiting the buckskin he wore.\\n\\n\"Ay, \\'twas judgmatical, and like themselves; though we were too expart\\nto be thrown from a trail by so common an invention.\"\\n\\n\"To what, then, are we indebted for our safety?\"\\n\\n\"To what, as a white man who has no taint of Indian blood, I should be\\nashamed to own; to the judgment of the young Mohican, in matters which I\\nshould know better than he, but which I can now hardly believe to be\\ntrue, though my own eyes tell me it is so.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis extraordinary! will you not name the reason?\"\\n\\n\"Uncas was bold enough to say, that the beasts ridden by the gentle\\nones,\" continued Hawkeye, glancing his eyes, not without curious\\ninterest, on the fillies of the ladies, \"planted the legs of one side on\\nthe ground at the same time, which is contrary to the movements of all\\ntrotting four-footed animals of my knowledge, except the bear. And yet\\nhere are horses that always journey in this manner, as my own eyes have\\nseen, and as their trail has shown for twenty long miles.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis the merit of the animal! They come from the shores of\\nNarragansett Bay, in the small province of Providence Plantations, and\\nare celebrated for their hardihood, and the ease of this peculiar\\nmovement; though other horses are not unfrequently trained to the same.\"\\n\\n\"It may be--it may be,\" said Hawkeye, who had listened with singular\\nattention to this explanation; \"though I am a man who has the full blood\\nof the whites, my judgment in deer and beaver is greater than in beasts\\nof burden. Major Effingham has many noble chargers, but I have never\\nseen one travel after such a sideling gait.\"\\n\\n\"True; for he would value the animals for very different properties.\\nStill is this a breed highly esteemed, and as you witness, much honored\\nwith the burdens it is often destined to bear.\"\\n\\nThe Mohicans had suspended their operations about the glimmering fire,\\nto listen; and when Duncan had done, they looked at each other\\nsignificantly, the father uttering the never-failing exclamation of\\nsurprise. The scout ruminated, like a man digesting his newly acquired\\nknowledge, and once more stole a curious glance at the horses.\\n\\n\"I dare to say there are even stranger sights to be seen in the\\nsettlements!\" he said, at length; \"natur\\' is sadly abused by man, when\\nhe once gets the mastery. But, go sideling or go straight, Uncas had\\nseen the movement, and their trail led us on to the broken bush. The\\nouter branch, near the prints of one of the horses, was bent upward, as\\na lady breaks a flower from its stem, but all the rest were ragged and\\nbroken down, as if the strong hand of a man had been tearing them! So I\\nconcluded that the cunning varmints had seen the twig bent, and had torn\\nthe rest, to make us believe a buck had been feeling the boughs with his\\nantlers.\"\\n\\n\"I do believe your sagacity did not deceive you; for some such thing\\noccurred!\"\\n\\n\"That was easy to see,\" added the scout, in no degree conscious of\\nhaving exhibited any extraordinary sagacity; \"and a very different\\nmatter it was from a waddling horse! It then struck me the Mingos would\\npush for this spring, for the knaves well know the vartue of its\\nwaters!\"\\n\\n\"Is it, then, so famous?\" demanded Heyward, examining, with a more\\ncurious eye, the secluded dell, with its bubbling fountain, surrounded,\\nas it was, by earth of a deep dingy brown.\\n\\n\"Few redskins, who travel south and east of the great lakes, but have\\nheard of its qualities. Will you taste for yourself?\"\\n\\nHeyward took the gourd, and after swallowing a little of the water,\\nthrew it aside with grimaces of discontent. The scout laughed in his\\nsilent, but heartfelt manner, and shook his head with vast satisfaction.\\n\\n\"Ah! you want the flavor that one gets by habit; the time was when I\\nliked it as little as yourself; but I have come to my taste, and I now\\ncrave it, as a deer does the licks.[17] Your high spiced wines are not\\nbetter liked than a redskin relishes this water; especially when his\\nnatur\\' is ailing. But Uncas has made his fire, and it is time we think\\nof eating, for our journey is long, and all before us.\"\\n\\nInterrupting the dialogue by this abrupt transition, the scout had\\ninstant recourse to the fragments of food which had escaped the voracity\\nof the Hurons. A very summary process completed the simple cookery, when\\nhe and the Mohicans commenced their humble meal, with the silence and\\ncharacteristic diligence of men who ate in order to enable themselves\\nto endure great and unremitting toil.\\n\\nWhen this necessary, and, happily, grateful duty had been performed,\\neach of the foresters stooped and took a long and parting draught at\\nthat solitary and silent spring,[18] around which and its sister\\nfountains, within fifty years, the wealth, beauty, and talents of a\\nhemisphere were to assemble in throngs, in pursuit of health and\\npleasure. Then Hawkeye announced his determination to proceed. The\\nsisters resumed their saddles; Duncan and David grasped their rifles,\\nand followed on their footsteps; the scout leading the advance, and the\\nMohicans bringing up the rear. The whole party moved swiftly through the\\nnarrow path, towards the north, leaving the healing waters to mingle\\nunheeded with the adjacent brook, and the bodies of the dead to fester\\non the neighboring mount, without the rites of sepulture; a fate but too\\ncommon to the warriors of the woods to excite either commiseration or\\ncomment.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "    'summary_text': 'Since the Indians\\' rifles have been placed to the side, Hawkeye has found his, loaded it, and fired it. He and the Mohicans advance to hand-to-hand combat, Uncas jumping protectively in front of Cora and saving her a moment later by killing an Indian whose tomahawk has cut her bonds. Soon all the Hurons are dead except Magua, who is fighting with Chingachgook. The villain feigns death and escapes before Hawkeye can brain him with the butt of his rifle. Chingachgook scalps the dead while Uncas and Heyward assist the females and Hawkeye releases Gamut. The scout advises the singing master to give up his \"little tooting instrument\" for a useful weapon, and Gamut counters by arguing the fatality of Calvinistic doctrine found in books. Completely the practical man, Hawkeye disdainfully says that the only book worth reading is nature. Gamut\\'s response is to sing a song, but Hawkeye common-sensically reloads his rifle and sees that everyone is armed. Then they start their journey with the girls riding the Narragansets. They very shortly stop and clear the leaves and clay from a hidden mineral spring, and Hawkeye tells how the three of them, sagaciously aided by Uncas, had tracked the Hurons for twenty miles. After a simple cooked meal, they proceed towards the north where Fort William Henry lies.',\n",
       "    'summary_analysis': 'This is another bloody chapter, but its thematic significance is in the views of Gamut and Hawkeye. At first the psalmodist seems to have learned nothing from his recent experiences, yet it is notable that, whereas before he has done little more than sing and mouth religious platitudes, he now turns to doctrine and argument as if he must go deeper into his beliefs to convince Hawkeye and perhaps himself. Although in this instance the Yankee\\'s singing is a retreat as the scout gets the better of the discussion, Cooper gives Gamut his due as a folklore figure, \"a minstrel of the western continent . . . after the spirit of his own age and country.\" Hawkeye says that the recent action \"was all foreordered, and for the best.\" But he will admit such only after events have actually occurred, not beforehand as Gamut\\'s Calvinistic predestination insists upon. As something of a deist, he reads God in nature: \"I know not but man may so deform his works in the settlement, as to leave that which is so clear in the wilderness a matter of doubt among traders and priests.\" A few minutes later talking about the unusual way the Narragansets have been trained to walk, he comments that \"natur\\' is sadly abused by man, when he once gets the mastery.\" His point is that people should not seek absolute mastery and try to rival God. Highly pragmatic, he finds that the greatest lesson taught by nature is humility. He is the noble, self-outcast frontiersman who has turned his back on the settlement to seek, as a thinking man, the freedom and simplicity of natural morality; and he prefers this even though  it entails danger and killing. Since Cooper is developing some interest between Uncas and Cora, just before mid-chapter he carefully presents Uncas as showing \"a sympathy that elevated him far above the intelligence, and advanced him probably centuries before the practices of his nation.\" Though he will not fully allow it later, Cooper is presently trying to make their mutual interest acceptable and believable.',\n",

Under the hillock are the long-dead Mohawks, the memory of whom makes Hawkeye once again refer to the two Mohicans as the last of their tribe. All except Chingachgook fall asleep and awaken at the rising of the moon to continue their journey. Before they can leave, they hear the steps of some twenty enemy Indians who have apparently lost their trail. While the protagonists wait in quiet suspense, two Hurons approach the mound but warily withdraw out of respect for the dead. As soon as the sounds of the hunters completely fade away, the seven fugitives silently head north again. After tactically walking barefoot in a stream for an hour, they turn again to the plain and reach the \\\\\"bloody pond,\\\\\" where in a previous battle Frenchmen had been surprised, slain, and tossed into the water. Being now near the French outposts, they encounter a French sentinel, whom Heyward fools by answering in French and whom Chingachgook slips upon, kills, and scalps. Since they must turn back for safety, Hawkeye leads them up a mountain from which, as morning comes, they can see to the east Fort William Henry on the southern tip of Lake George. Between them and the fort are General Montcalm\\'s ten thousand Frenchmen, while to the southeast is the camped detachment from Fort Edward. Firing has already started, but as a great fog descends, the party plans to push through it to the fort. They have strayed from their way when a cannon ball from the fort rolls to a stop near them and they decide to follow its furrow to safety. Again running into French forces, they have to flee and become lost until Uncas finds the furrow again. They are hotly pursued, but within minutes they are beneath the walls of the fort, where Munro recognizes the voice of Alice and orders his men out the sally-port. Led by Heyward, the English disperse the French as the gigantic, grey-haired Munro, large tears rolling down his cheeks, embraces his two daughters in his arms.\", \"analysis\": \"The story has now reached the end of the first long chase, during which one pattern of pursuit-capture-escape-and-pursuit is completed. But Cooper has made sure that the present safety for the main characters is only relative. He has made the reader aware that the defending English are far outnumbered and contained by the ten thousand French and their Indian allies; even the sentimental reader who may feel relief and a gush of emotional release at the reunion of the father and daughters knows that the protagonists now face the double danger of foes and can no longer maneuver as they did in the forests. If any lull is to come, it will be in terms of action, not suspense. The action here is so intense that little individual characterization is presented. Gamut is barely present, and Uncas apparently has no chance to show his interest in Cora. At one point Hawkeye relates some of the history of the tribe of Mohicans, and his reference to his two companions keeps alive the background theme of tribal demise. But rather than its setting him apart as an individual, Chingachgook\\'s taking of scalps merely shows how much he still has in common with all other Indians, though his actions do stand in contrast to Uncas\\' behavior in the preceding chapter. Hawkeye, who sees Chingachgook\\'s actions as part of his Indian \\\\\"gift,\\\\\" evinces one new character element with his superstition at the \\\\\"bloody pond.\\\\\" However, since Cooper is busy rounding out his action, he does not dwell on theme or characterization in these moments.\"}',\n",
       "    'chapter': '\\n  \"I\\'ll seek a readier path.\"\\n\\n  PARNELL.\\n\\n\\nThe route taken by Hawkeye lay across those sandy plains, relieved by\\noccasional valleys and swells of land, which had been traversed by their\\nparty on the morning of the same day, with the baffled Magua for their\\nguide. The sun had now fallen low towards the distant mountains; and as\\ntheir journey lay through the interminable forest, the heat was no\\nlonger oppressive. Their progress, in consequence, was proportionate;\\nand long before the twilight gathered about them, they had made good\\nmany toilsome miles on their return.\\n\\nThe hunter, like the savage whose place he filled, seemed to select\\namong the blind signs of their wild route, with a species of instinct,\\nseldom abating his speed, and never pausing to deliberate. A rapid and\\noblique glance at the moss on the trees, with an occasional upward gaze\\ntowards the setting sun, or a steady but passing look at the direction\\nof the numerous water-courses, through which he waded, were sufficient\\nto determine his path, and remove his greatest difficulties. In the\\nmeantime, the forest began to change its hues, losing that lively green\\nwhich had embellished its arches, in the graver light which is the usual\\nprecursor of the close of day.\\n\\nWhile the eyes of the sisters were endeavoring to catch glimpses through\\nthe trees, of the flood of golden glory which formed a glittering halo\\naround the sun, tinging here and there with ruby streaks, or bordering\\nwith narrow edgings of shining yellow, a mass of clouds that lay piled\\nat no great distance above the western hills, Hawkeye turned suddenly,\\nand, pointing upwards towards the gorgeous heavens, he spoke:--\\n\\n\"Yonder is the signal given to a man to seek his food and natural rest,\"\\nhe said: \"better and wiser would it be, if he could understand the signs\\nof nature, and take a lesson from the fowls of the air and the beasts of\\nthe fields! Our night, however, will soon be over; for, with the moon,\\nwe must be up and moving again. I remember to have fou\\'t the Maquas,\\nhereaways, in the first war in which I ever drew blood from man; and we\\nthrew up a work of blocks, to keep the ravenous varmints from handling\\nour scalps. If my marks do not fail me, we shall find the place a few\\nrods farther to our left.\"\\n\\nWithout waiting for an assent, or, indeed, for any reply, the sturdy\\nhunter moved boldly into a dense thicket of young chestnuts, shoving\\naside the branches of the exuberant shoots which nearly covered the\\nground, like a man who expected, at each step, to discover some object\\nhe had formerly known. The recollection of the scout did not deceive\\nhim. After penetrating through the brush, matted as it was with briers,\\nfor a few hundred feet he entered an open space, that surrounded a low,\\ngreen hillock, which was crowned by the decayed block-house in question.\\nThis rude and neglected building was one of those deserted works, which,\\nhaving been thrown up on an emergency, had been abandoned with the\\ndisappearance of danger, and was now quietly crumbling in the solitude\\nof the forest, neglected, and nearly forgotten, like the circumstances\\nwhich had caused it to be reared. Such memorials of the passage and\\nstruggles of man are yet frequent throughout the broad barrier of\\nwilderness which once separated the hostile provinces, and form a\\nspecies of ruins that are intimately associated with the recollections\\nof colonial history, and which are in appropriate keeping with the\\ngloomy character of the surrounding scenery.[19] The roof of bark had\\nlong since fallen, and mingled with the soil; but the huge logs of pine,\\nwhich had been hastily thrown together, still preserved their relative\\npositions, though one angle of the work had given way under the\\npressure, and threatened a speedy downfall to the remainder of the\\nrustic edifice. While Heyward and his companions hesitated to approach a\\nbuilding so decayed, Hawkeye and the Indians entered within the low\\nwalls, not only without fear, but with obvious interest. While the\\nformer surveyed the ruins, both internally and externally, with the\\ncuriosity of one whose recollections were reviving at each moment,\\nChingachgook related to his son, in the language of the Delawares, and\\nwith the pride of a conqueror, the brief history of the skirmish which\\nhad been fought, in his youth, in that secluded spot. A strain of\\nmelancholy, however, blended with his triumph, rendering his voice, as\\nusual, soft and musical.\\n\\nIn the meantime, the sisters gladly dismounted, and prepared to enjoy\\ntheir halt in the coolness of the evening, and in a security which they\\nbelieved nothing but the beasts of the forest could invade.\\n\\n\"Would not our resting-place have been more retired, my worthy friend,\"\\ndemanded the more vigilant Duncan, perceiving that the scout had already\\nfinished his short survey, \"had we chosen a spot less known, and one\\nmore rarely visited than this?\"\\n\\n\"Few live who know the block-house was ever raised,\" was the slow and\\nmusing answer; \"\\'tis not often that books are made, and narratives\\nwritten, of such a scrimmage as was here fou\\'t atween the Mohicans and\\nthe Mohawks, in a war of their own waging. I was then a younker, and\\nwent out with the Delawares, because I know\\'d they were a scandalized\\nand wronged race. Forty days and forty nights did the imps crave our\\nblood around this pile of logs, which I designed and partly reared,\\nbeing, as you\\'ll remember, no Indian myself, but a man without a cross.\\nThe Delawares lent themselves to the work, and we made it good, ten to\\ntwenty, until our numbers were nearly equal, and then we sallied out\\nupon the hounds, and not a man of them ever got back to tell the fate of\\nhis party. Yes, yes; I was then young, and new to the sight of blood;\\nand not relishing the thought that creatures who had spirits like myself\\nshould lay on the naked ground, to be torn asunder by beasts, or to\\nbleach in the rains, I buried the dead with my own hands, under that\\nvery little hillock where you have placed yourselves; and no bad seat\\ndoes it make neither, though it be raised by the bones of mortal men.\"\\n\\nHeyward and the sisters arose, on the instant, from the grassy\\nsepulchre; nor could the two latter, notwithstanding the terrific scenes\\nthey had so recently passed through, entirely suppress an emotion of\\nnatural horror, when they found themselves in such familiar contact with\\nthe grave of the dead Mohawks. The gray light, the gloomy little area of\\ndark grass, surrounded by its border of brush, beyond which the pines\\nrose, in breathing silence, apparently, into the very clouds, and the\\ndeath-like stillness of the vast forest, were all in unison to deepen\\nsuch a sensation.\\n\\n\"They are gone, and they are harmless,\" continued Hawkeye, waving his\\nhand, with a melancholy smile, at their manifest alarm: \"they\\'ll never\\nshout the war-whoop nor strike a blow with the tomahawk again! And of\\nall those who aided in placing them where they lie, Chingachgook and I\\nonly are living! The brothers and family of the Mohican formed our\\nwar-party; and you see before you all that are now left of his race.\"\\n\\nThe eyes of the listeners involuntarily sought the forms of the Indians,\\nwith a compassionate interest in their desolate fortune. The dark\\npersons were still to be seen within the shadows of the block-house, the\\nson listening to the relation of his father with that sort of\\nintenseness which would be created by a narrative that redounded so much\\nto the honor of those whose names he had long revered for their courage\\nand savage virtues.\\n\\n\"I had thought the Delawares a pacific people,\" said Duncan, \"and that\\nthey never waged war in person; trusting the defence of their lands to\\nthose very Mohawks that you slew!\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis true in part,\" returned the scout, \"and yet, at the bottom, \\'tis a\\nwicked lie. Such a treaty was made in ages gone by, through the\\ndeviltries of the Dutchers, who wished to disarm the natives that had\\nthe best right to the country where they had settled themselves. The\\nMohicans, though a part of the same nation, having to deal with the\\nEnglish, never entered into the silly bargain, but kept to their\\nmanhood; as in truth did the Delawares, when their eyes were opened to\\ntheir folly. You see before you a chief of the great Mohican Sagamores!\\nOnce his family could chase their deer over tracts of country wider than\\nthat which belongs to the Albany Patteroon, without crossing brook or\\nhill that was not their own; but what is left to their descendant! He\\nmay find his six feet of earth when God chooses, and keep it in peace,\\nperhaps, if he has a friend who will take the pains to sink his head so\\nlow that the ploughshares cannot reach it!\"\\n\\n\"Enough!\" said Heyward, apprehensive that the subject might lead to a\\ndiscussion that would interrupt the harmony so necessary to the\\npreservation of his fair companions: \"we have journeyed far, and few\\namong us are blessed with forms like that of yours, which seems to know\\nneither fatigue nor weakness.\"\\n\\n\"The sinews and bones of a man carry me through it all,\" said the\\nhunter, surveying his muscular limbs with a simplicity that betrayed the\\nhonest pleasure the compliment afforded him: \"there are larger and\\nheavier men to be found in the settlements, but you might travel many\\ndays in a city before you could meet one able to walk fifty miles\\nwithout stopping to take breath, or who has kept the hounds within\\nhearing during a chase of hours. However, as flesh and blood are not\\nalways the same, it is quite reasonable to suppose that the gentle ones\\nare willing to rest, after all they have seen and done this day. Uncas,\\nclear out the spring, while your father and I make a cover for their\\ntender heads of these chestnut shoots, and a bed of grass and leaves.\"\\n\\nThe dialogue ceased, while the hunter and his companions busied\\nthemselves in preparations for the comfort and protection of those they\\nguided. A spring, which many long years before had induced the natives\\nto select the place for their temporary fortification, was soon cleared\\nof leaves, and a fountain of crystal gushed from the bed, diffusing its\\nwaters over the verdant hillock. A corner of the building was then\\nroofed in such a manner as to exclude the heavy dew of the climate, and\\npiles of sweet shrubs and dried leaves were laid beneath it for the\\nsisters to repose on.\\n\\nWhile the diligent woodsmen were employed in this manner, Cora and Alice\\npartook of that refreshment which duty required much more than\\ninclination prompted them to accept. They then retired within the walls,\\nand first offering up their thanksgivings for past mercies, and\\npetitioning for a continuance of the divine favor throughout the coming\\nnight, they laid their tender forms on the fragrant couch, and in spite\\nof recollections and forebodings, soon sank into those slumbers which\\nnature so imperiously demanded, and which were sweetened by hopes for\\nthe morrow. Duncan had prepared himself to pass the night in\\nwatchfulness near them, just without the ruin, but the scout, perceiving\\nhis intention, pointed towards Chingachgook, as he coolly disposed his\\nown person on the grass, and said--\\n\\n\"The eyes of a white man are too heavy and too blind for such a watch as\\nthis! The Mohican will be our sentinel, therefore let us sleep.\"\\n\\n\"I proved myself a sluggard on my post during the past night,\" said\\nHeyward, \"and have less need of repose than you, who did more credit to\\nthe character of a soldier. Let all the party seek their rest, then,\\nwhile I hold guard.\"\\n\\n\"If we lay among the white tents of the 60th, and in front of an enemy\\nlike the French, I could not ask for a better watchman,\" returned the\\nscout; \"but in the darkness and among the signs of the wilderness your\\njudgment would be like the folly of a child, and your vigilance thrown\\naway. Do then, like Uncas and myself, sleep, and sleep in safety.\"\\n\\nHeyward perceived, in truth, that the younger Indian had thrown his form\\non the side of the hillock while they were talking, like one who sought\\nto make the most of the time allotted to rest, and that his example had\\nbeen followed by David, whose voice literally \"clove to his jaws,\" with\\nthe fever of his wound, heightened, as it was, by their toilsome march.\\nUnwilling to prolong a useless discussion, the young man affected to\\ncomply, by posting his back against the logs of the block-house, in a\\nhalf-recumbent posture, though resolutely determined, in his own mind,\\nnot to close an eye until he had delivered his precious charge into the\\narms of Munro himself. Hawkeye, believing he had prevailed, soon fell\\nasleep, and a silence as deep as the solitude in which they had found\\nit, pervaded the retired spot.\\n\\nFor many minutes Duncan succeeded in keeping his senses on the alert,\\nand alive to every moaning sound that arose from the forest. His vision\\nbecame more acute as the shades of evening settled on the place; and\\neven after the stars were glimmering above his head, he was able to\\ndistinguish the recumbent forms of his companions, as they lay stretched\\non the grass, and to note the person of Chingachgook, who sat upright\\nand motionless as one of the trees which formed the dark barrier on\\nevery side. He still heard the gentle breathings of the sisters, who lay\\nwithin a few feet of him, and not a leaf was ruffled by the passing air,\\nof which his ear did not detect the whispering sound. At length,\\nhowever, the mournful notes of a whippoorwill became blended with the\\nmoanings of an owl; his heavy eyes occasionally sought the bright rays\\nof the stars, and then he fancied he saw them through the fallen lids.\\nAt instants of momentary wakefulness he mistook a bush for his associate\\nsentinel; his head next sank upon his shoulder, which, in its turn,\\nsought the support of the ground; and, finally, his whole person become\\nrelaxed and pliant, and the young man sank into a deep sleep, dreaming\\nthat he was a knight of ancient chivalry, holding his midnight vigils\\nbefore the tent of a recaptured princess, whose favor he did not despair\\nof gaining, by such a proof of devotion and watchfulness.\\n\\nHow long the tired Duncan lay in this insensible state he never knew\\nhimself, but his slumbering visions had been long lost in total\\nforgetfulness, when he was awakened by a light tap on the shoulder.\\nAroused by this signal, slight as it was, he sprang upon his feet with a\\nconfused recollection of the self-imposed duty he had assumed with the\\ncommencement of the night.\\n\\n\"Who comes?\" he demanded, feeling for his sword at the place where it\\nwas usually suspended, \"Speak! friend or enemy?\"\\n\\n\"Friend,\" replied the low voice of Chingachgook; who, pointing upwards\\nat the luminary which was shedding its mild light through the opening in\\nthe trees, directly in their bivouac, immediately added, in his rude\\nEnglish, \"moon comes, and white man\\'s fort far--far off; time to move,\\nwhen sleep shuts both eyes of the Frenchman!\"\\n\\n\"You say true! call up your friends, and bridle the horses, while I\\nprepare my own companions for the march!\"\\n\\n\"We are awake, Duncan,\" said the soft, silvery tones of Alice within the\\nbuilding, \"and ready to travel very fast after so refreshing a sleep;\\nbut you have watched through the tedious night in our behalf, after\\nhaving endured so much fatigue the live-long day!\"\\n\\n\"Say, rather, I would have watched, but my treacherous eyes betrayed me;\\ntwice have I proved myself unfit for the trust I bear.\"\\n\\n\"Nay, Duncan, deny it not,\" interrupted the smiling Alice, issuing from\\nthe shadows of the building into the light of the moon, in all the\\nloveliness of her freshened beauty; \"I know you to be a heedless one,\\nwhen self is the object of your care, and but too vigilant in favor of\\nothers. Can we not tarry here a little longer, while you find the rest\\nyou need? Cheerfully, most cheerfully, will Cora and I keep the vigils,\\nwhile you, and all these brave men, endeavor to snatch a little sleep!\"\\n\\n\"If shame could cure me of my drowsiness, I should never close an eye\\nagain,\" said the uneasy youth, gazing at the ingenuous countenance of\\nAlice, where, however, in its sweet solicitude, he read nothing to\\nconfirm his half awakened suspicion. \"It is but too true, that after\\nleading you into danger by my heedlessness, I have not even the merit of\\nguarding your pillows as should become a soldier.\"\\n\\n\"No one but Duncan himself should accuse Duncan of such a weakness. Go,\\nthen, and sleep; believe me, neither of us, weak girls as we are, will\\nbetray our watch.\"\\n\\nThe young man was relieved from the awkwardness of making any further\\nprotestations of his own demerits, by an exclamation from Chingachgook,\\nand the attitude of riveted attention assumed by his son.\\n\\n\"The Mohicans hear an enemy!\" whispered Hawkeye, who, by this time, in\\ncommon with the whole party, was awake and stirring. \"They scent danger\\nin the wind!\"\\n\\n\"God forbid!\" exclaimed Heyward. \"Surely we have had enough of\\nbloodshed!\"\\n\\nWhile he spoke, however, the young soldier seized his rifle, and\\nadvancing towards the front, prepared to atone for his venial\\nremissness, by freely exposing his life in defence of those he attended.\\n\\n\"\\'Tis some creature of the forest prowling around us in quest of food,\"\\nhe said, in a whisper, as soon as the low, and apparently distant\\nsounds, which had startled the Mohicans, reached his own ears.\\n\\n\"Hist!\" returned the attentive scout; \"\\'tis man; even I can now tell his\\ntread, poor as my senses are when compared to an Indian\\'s! That\\nscampering Huron has fallen in with one of Montcalm\\'s outlying parties,\\nand they have struck upon our trail. I shouldn\\'t like, myself, to spill\\nmore human blood in this spot,\" he added, looking around with anxiety in\\nhis features, at the dim objects by which he was surrounded; \"but what\\nmust be, must! Lead the horses into the block-house, Uncas; and,\\nfriends, do you follow to the same shelter. Poor and old as it is, it\\noffers a cover, and has rung with the crack of a rifle afore to-night!\"\\n\\nHe was instantly obeyed, the Mohicans leading the Narragansetts within\\nthe ruin, whither the whole party repaired with the most guarded\\nsilence.\\n\\nThe sounds of approaching footsteps were now too distinctly audible to\\nleave any doubts as to the nature of the interruption. They were soon\\nmingled with voices calling to each other in an Indian dialect, which\\nthe hunter, in a whisper, affirmed to Heyward was the language of the\\nHurons. When the party reached the point where the horses had entered\\nthe thicket which surrounded the block-house, they were evidently at\\nfault, having lost those marks which, until that moment, had directed\\ntheir pursuit.\\n\\nIt would seem by the voices that twenty men were soon collected at that\\none spot, mingling their different opinions and advice in noisy clamor.\\n\\n\"The knaves know our weakness,\" whispered Hawkeye, who stood by the side\\nof Heyward, in deep shade, looking through an opening in the logs, \"or\\nthey wouldn\\'t indulge their idleness in such a squaw\\'s march. Listen to\\nthe reptiles! each man among them seems to have two tongues, and but a\\nsingle leg.\"\\n\\nDuncan, brave as he was in the combat, could not, in such a moment of\\npainful suspense, make any reply to the cool and characteristic remark\\nof the scout. He only grasped his rifle more firmly, and fastened his\\neyes upon the narrow opening, through which he gazed upon the moonlight\\nview with increasing anxiety. The deeper tones of one who spoke as\\nhaving authority were next heard, amid a silence that denoted the\\nrespect with which his orders, or rather advice, was received. After\\nwhich, by the rustling of leaves, and cracking of dried twigs, it was\\napparent the savages were separating in pursuit of the lost trail.\\nFortunately for the pursued, the light of the moon, while it shed a\\nflood of mild lustre upon the little area around the ruin, was not\\nsufficiently strong to penetrate the deep arches of the forest, where\\nthe objects still lay in deceptive shadow. The search proved fruitless;\\nfor so short and sudden had been the passage from the faint path the\\ntravellers had journeyed into the thicket, that every trace of their\\nfootsteps was lost in the obscurity of the woods.\\n\\nIt was not long, however, before the restless savages were heard beating\\nthe brush, and gradually approaching the inner edge of that dense border\\nof young chestnuts which encircled the little area.\\n\\n\"They are coming,\" muttered Heyward, endeavoring to thrust his rifle\\nthrough the chink in the logs; \"let us fire on their approach.\"\\n\\n\"Keep everything in the shade,\" returned the scout; \"the snapping of a\\nflint, or even the smell of a single karnel of the brimstone, would\\nbring the hungry varlets upon us in a body. Should it please God that we\\nmust give battle for the scalps, trust to the experience of men who know\\nthe ways of the savages, and who are not often backward when the\\nwar-whoop is howled.\"\\n\\nDuncan cast his eyes behind him, and saw that the trembling sisters were\\ncowering in the far corner of the building, while the Mohicans stood in\\nthe shadow, like two upright posts, ready, and apparently willing, to\\nstrike when the blow should be needed. Curbing his impatience, he again\\nlooked out upon the area, and awaited the result in silence. At that\\ninstant the thicket opened, and a tall and armed Huron advanced a few\\npaces into the open space. As he gazed upon the silent block-house, the\\nmoon fell upon his swarthy countenance, and betrayed its surprise and\\ncuriosity. He made the exclamation which usually accompanies the former\\nemotion in an Indian, and, calling in a low voice, soon drew a companion\\nto his side.\\n\\nThese children of the woods stood together for several moments pointing\\nat the crumbling edifice, and conversing in the unintelligible language\\nof their tribe. They then approached, though with slow and cautious\\nsteps, pausing every instant to look at the building, like startled\\ndeer, whose curiosity struggled powerfully with their awakened\\napprehensions for the mastery. The foot of one of them suddenly rested\\non the mound, and he stooped to examine its nature. At this moment,\\nHeyward observed that the scout loosened his knife in his sheath, and\\nlowered the muzzle of his rifle. Imitating these movements, the young\\nman prepared himself for the struggle, which now seemed inevitable.\\n\\nThe savages were so near, that the least motion in one of the horses, or\\neven a breath louder than common, would have betrayed the fugitives.\\nBut, in discovering the character of the mound, the attention of the\\nHurons appeared directed to a different object. They spoke together, and\\nthe sounds of their voices were low and solemn, as if influenced by a\\nreverence that was deeply blended with awe. Then they drew warily back,\\nkeeping their eyes riveted on the ruin, as if they expected to see the\\napparitions of the dead issue from its silent walls, until having\\nreached the boundary of the area, they moved slowly into the thicket,\\nand disappeared.\\n\\nHawkeye dropped the breech of his rifle to the earth, and drawing a\\nlong, free breath, exclaimed, in an audible whisper,--\\n\\n\"Ay! they respect the dead, and it has this time saved their own lives,\\nand, it may be, the lives of better men too.\"\\n\\nHeyward lent his attention for a single moment to his companion, but\\nwithout replying, he again turned towards those who just then interested\\nhim more. He heard the two Hurons leave the bushes, and it was soon\\nplain that all the pursuers were gathered about them, in deep attention\\nto their report. After a few minutes of earnest and solemn dialogue,\\naltogether different from the noisy clamor with which they had first\\ncollected about the spot, the sounds grew fainter and more distant, and\\nfinally were lost in the depths of the forest.\\n\\nHawkeye waited until a signal from the listening Chingachgook assured\\nhim that every sound from the retiring party was completely swallowed by\\nthe distance, when he motioned to Heyward to lead forth the horses, and\\nto assist the sisters into their saddles. The instant this was done,\\nthey issued through the broken gateway, and stealing out by a direction\\nopposite to the one by which they had entered, they quitted the spot,\\nthe sisters casting furtive glances at the silent grave and crumbling\\nruin, as they left the soft light of the moon, to bury themselves in the\\ngloom of the woods.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \"_Guard._--Qui est la?\\n\\n  _Puc._--Paisans, pauvres gens de France.\"\\n\\n  _King Henry VI._\\n\\n\\nDuring the rapid movement from the block-house, and until the party was\\ndeeply buried in the forest, each individual was too much interested in\\nthe escape to hazard a word even in whispers. The scout resumed his post\\nin the advance, though his steps, after he had thrown a safe distance\\nbetween himself and his enemies, were more deliberate than in their\\nprevious march, in consequence of his utter ignorance of the localities\\nof the surrounding woods. More than once he halted to consult with his\\nconfederates, the Mohicans, pointing upwards at the moon, and examining\\nthe barks of the trees with care. In these brief pauses, Heyward and the\\nsisters listened, with senses rendered doubly acute by the danger, to\\ndetect any symptoms which might announce the proximity of their foes. At\\nsuch moments, it seemed as if a vast range of country lay buried in\\neternal sleep; not the least sound arising from the forest, unless it\\nwas the distant and scarcely audible rippling of a water-course. Birds,\\nbeasts, and man, appeared to slumber alike, if, indeed, any of the\\nlatter were to be found in that wide tract of wilderness. But the sounds\\nof the rivulet, feeble and murmuring as they were, relieved the guides\\nat once from no trifling embarrassment, and towards it they immediately\\nheld their way.\\n\\nWhen the banks of the little stream were gained, Hawkeye made another\\nhalt; and, taking the moccasins from his feet, he invited Heyward and\\nGamut to follow his example. He then entered the water, and for near an\\nhour they travelled in the bed of the brook, leaving no trail. The moon\\nhad already sunk into an immense pile of black clouds, which lay\\nimpending above the western horizon, when they issued from the low and\\ndevious water-course to rise again to the light and level of the sandy\\nbut wooded plain. Here the scout seemed to be once more at home, for he\\nheld on his way with the certainty and diligence of a man who moved in\\nthe security of his own knowledge. The path soon became more uneven, and\\nthe travellers could plainly perceive that the mountains drew nigher to\\nthem on each hand, and that they were, in truth, about entering one of\\ntheir gorges. Suddenly, Hawkeye made a pause, and waiting until he was\\njoined by the whole party, he spoke, though in tones so low and\\ncautious, that they added to the solemnity of his words, in the quiet\\nand darkness of the place.\\n\\n\"It is easy to know the pathways, and to find the licks and\\nwater-courses of the wilderness,\" he said; \"but who that saw this spot\\ncould venture to say, that a mighty army was at rest among yonder silent\\ntrees and barren mountains?\"\\n\\n\"We are then at no great distance from William Henry?\" said Heyward,\\nadvancing nigher to the scout.\\n\\n\"It is yet a long and weary path, and when and where to strike it, is\\nnow our greatest difficulty. See,\" he said, pointing through the trees\\ntowards a spot where a little basin of water reflected the stars from\\nits placid bosom, \"here is the \\'bloody pond\\'; and I am on the ground\\nthat I have not only often travelled, but over which I have fou\\'t the\\nenemy, from the rising to the setting sun.\"\\n\\n\"Ha! that sheet of dull and dreary water, then, is the sepulchre of the\\nbrave men who fell in the contest. I have heard it named, but never have\\nI stood on its banks before.\"\\n\\n\"Three battles did we make with the Dutch-Frenchman[20] in a day,\"\\ncontinued Hawkeye, pursuing the train of his own thoughts, rather than\\nreplying to the remark of Duncan. \"He met us hard by, in our outward\\nmarch to ambush his advance, and scattered us, like driven deer, through\\nthe defile, to the shores of Horican. Then we rallied behind our fallen\\ntrees, and made head against him, under Sir William--who was made Sir\\nWilliam for that very deed; and well did we pay him for the disgrace of\\nthe morning! Hundreds of Frenchmen saw the sun that day for the last\\ntime; and even the leader, Dieskau himself, fell into our hands so cut\\nand torn with the lead, that he has gone back to his own country, unfit\\nfor further acts in war.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Twas a noble repulse!\" exclaimed Heyward, in the heat of his youthful\\nardor; \"the fame of it reached us early, in our southern army.\"\\n\\n\"Ay! but it did not end there. I was sent by Major Effingham, at Sir\\nWilliam\\'s own bidding, to outflank the French, and carry the tidings of\\ntheir disaster across the portage, to the fort on the Hudson. Just\\nhereaway, where you see the trees rise into a mountain swell, I met a\\nparty coming down to our aid, and I led them where the enemy were taking\\ntheir meal, little dreaming that they had not finished the bloody work\\nof the day.\"\\n\\n\"And you surprised them?\"\\n\\n\"If death can be a surprise to men who are thinking only of the cravings\\nof their appetites. We gave them but little breathing time, for they had\\nborne hard upon us in the fight of the morning, and there were few in\\nour party who had not lost friend or relative by their hands. When all\\nwas over, the dead, and some say the dying, were cast into that little\\npond. These eyes have seen its waters colored with blood, as natural\\nwater never yet flowed from the bowels of the \\'arth.\"\\n\\n\"It was a convenient, and, I trust, will prove a peaceful grave for a\\nsoldier. You have, then, seen much service on this frontier?\"\\n\\n\"I!\" said the scout, erecting his tall person with an air of military\\npride; \"there are not many echoes among these hills that haven\\'t rung\\nwith the crack of my rifle, nor is there the space of a square mile\\natwixt Horican and the river, that \\'Killdeer\\' hasn\\'t dropped a living\\nbody on, be it an enemy or be it a brute beast. As for the grave, there,\\nbeing as quiet as you mention, it is another matter. There are them in\\nthe camp who say and think, man, to lie still, should not be buried\\nwhile the breath is in the body; and certain it is that in the hurry of\\nthat evening, the doctors had but little time to say who was living and\\nwho was dead. Hist! see you nothing walking on the shore of the pond?\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis not probable that any are as houseless as ourselves, in this\\ndreary forest.\"\\n\\n\"Such as he may care but little for house or shelter, and night dew can\\nnever wet a body that passes its days in the water,\" returned the scout,\\ngrasping the shoulder of Heyward with such convulsive strength as to\\nmake the young soldier painfully sensible how much superstitious terror\\nhad got the mastery of a man usually so dauntless.\\n\\n\"By heaven! there is a human form, and it approaches! Stand to your\\narms, my friends; for we know not whom we encounter.\"\\n\\n\"Qui vive?\" demanded a stern, quick voice, which sounded like a\\nchallenge from another world, issuing out of that solitary and solemn\\nplace.\\n\\n\"What says it?\" whispered the scout; \"it speaks neither Indian nor\\nEnglish!\"\\n\\n\"Qui vive?\" repeated the same voice, which was quickly followed by the\\nrattling of arms, and a menacing attitude.\\n\\n\"France!\" cried Heyward, advancing from the shadow of the trees to the\\nshore of the pond, within a few yards of the sentinel.\\n\\n\"D\\'ou venez-vous--ou allez-vous, d\\'aussi bonne heure?\" demanded the\\ngrenadier, in the language and with the accent of a man from old France.\\n\\n\"Je viens de la decouverte, et je vais me coucher.\"\\n\\n\"Etes-vous officier du roi?\"\\n\\n\"Sans doute, mon camarade; me prends-tu pour un provincial! Je suis\\ncapitaine de chasseurs (Heyward well knew that the other was of a\\nregiment in the line); j\\'ai ici, avec moi, les filles du commandant de\\nla fortification. Aha! tu en as entendu parler! je les ai fait\\nprisonnieres pres de l\\'autre fort, et je les conduis au general.\"\\n\\n\"Ma foi! mesdames; j\\'en suis fache pour vous,\" exclaimed the young\\nsoldier, touching his cap with grace; \"mais--fortune de guerre! vous\\ntrouverez notre general un brave homme, et bien poli avec les dames.\"\\n\\n\"C\\'est le caractere des gens de guerre,\" said Cora, with admirable\\nself-possession. \"Adieu, mon ami; je vous souhaiterais un devoir plus\\nagreable a remplir.\"\\n\\nThe soldier made a low and humble acknowledgment for her civility; and\\nHeyward adding a \"Bonne nuit, mon camarade,\" they moved deliberately\\nforward, leaving the sentinel pacing the banks of the silent pond,\\nlittle suspecting an enemy of so much effrontery, and humming to himself\\nthose words, which were recalled to his mind by the sight of women, and\\nperhaps by recollections of his own distant and beautiful France--\\n\\n  \"Vive le vin, l\\'amour,\" etc., etc.\\n\\n\"\\'Tis well you understood the knave!\" whispered the scout, when they had\\ngained a little distance from the place, and letting his rifle fall into\\nthe hollow of his arm again; \"I soon saw that he was one of them uneasy\\nFrenchers; and well for him it was that his speech was friendly and his\\nwishes kind, or a place might have been found for his bones among those\\nof his countrymen.\"\\n\\nHe was interrupted by a long and heavy groan which arose from the little\\nbasin, as though, in truth, the spirits of the departed lingered about\\ntheir watery sepulchre.\\n\\n\"Surely it was of flesh!\" continued the scout; \"no spirit could handle\\nits arms so steadily!\"\\n\\n\"It _was_ of flesh; but whether the poor fellow still belongs to this\\nworld may well be doubted,\" said Heyward, glancing his eyes around him,\\nand missing Chingachgook from their little band. Another groan more\\nfaint than the former, was succeeded by a heavy and sullen plunge into\\nthe water, and all was as still again as if the borders of the dreary\\npool had never been awakened from the silence of creation. While they\\nyet hesitated in uncertainty, the form of the Indian was seen gliding\\nout of the thicket. As the chief rejoined them, with one hand he\\nattached the reeking scalp of the unfortunate young Frenchman to his\\ngirdle, and with the other he replaced the knife and tomahawk that had\\ndrunk his blood. He then took his wonted station, with the air of a man\\nwho believed he had done a deed of merit.\\n\\nThe scout dropped one end of his rifle to the earth, and leaning his\\nhands on the other, he stood musing in profound silence. Then shaking\\nhis head in a mournful manner, he muttered,--\\n\\n\"\\'T would have been a cruel and an unhuman act for a white-skin; but\\n\\'tis the gift and natur\\' of an Indian, and I suppose it should not be\\ndenied. I could wish, though, it had befallen an accursed Mingo, rather\\nthan that gay young boy from the old countries.\"\\n\\n\"Enough!\" said Heyward, apprehensive the unconscious sisters might\\ncomprehend the nature of the detention, and conquering his disgust by a\\ntrain of reflections very much like that of the hunter; \"\\'tis done; and\\nthough better it were left undone, cannot be amended. You see we are,\\ntoo obviously, within the sentinels of the enemy; what course do you\\npropose to follow?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Hawkeye, rousing himself again, \"\\'tis as you say, too late\\nto harbor further thoughts about it. Ay, the French have gathered around\\nthe fort in good earnest, and we have a delicate needle to thread in\\npassing them.\"\\n\\n\"And but little time to do it in,\" added Heyward, glancing his eyes\\nupward, toward the bank of vapor that concealed the setting moon.\\n\\n\"And little time to do it in!\" repeated the scout. \"The thing may be\\ndone in two fashions, by the help of Providence, without which it may\\nnot be done at all.\"\\n\\n\"Name them quickly, for time presses.\"\\n\\n\"One would be to dismount the gentle ones, and let their beasts range\\nthe plain; by sending the Mohicans in front, we might then cut a lane\\nthrough their sentries, and enter the fort over the dead bodies.\"\\n\\n\"It will not do--it will not do!\" interrupted the generous Heyward; \"a\\nsoldier might force his way in this manner, but never with such a\\nconvoy.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Twould be, indeed, a bloody path for tender feet to wade in,\" returned\\nthe equally reluctant scout; \"but I thought it befitting my manhood to\\nname it. We must then turn on our trail and get without the line of\\ntheir look-outs, when we will bend short to the west, and enter the\\nmountains; where I can hide you, so that all the devil\\'s hounds in\\nMontcalm\\'s pay would be thrown off the scent, for months to come.\"\\n\\n\"Let it be done, and that instantly.\"\\n\\nFurther words were unnecessary; for Hawkeye, merely uttering the mandate\\nto \"follow,\" moved along the route by which they had just entered their\\npresent critical and even dangerous situation. Their progress, like\\ntheir late dialogue, was guarded, and without noise; for none knew at\\nwhat moment a passing patrol, or a crouching picket of the enemy, might\\nrise upon their path. As they held their silent way along the margin of\\nthe pond, again Heyward and the scout stole furtive glances at its\\nappalling dreariness. They looked in vain for the form they had so\\nrecently seen stalking along its silent shores, while a low and regular\\nwash of the little waves, by announcing that the waters were not yet\\nsubsided, furnished a frightful memorial of the deed of blood they had\\njust witnessed. Like all that passing and gloomy scene, the low basin,\\nhowever, quickly melted in the darkness, and became blended with the\\nmass of black objects in the rear of the travellers.\\n\\nHawkeye soon deviated from the line of their retreat, and striking off\\ntowards the mountains which form the western boundary of the narrow\\nplain, he led his followers, with swift steps, deep within the shadows\\nthat were cast from their high and broken summits. The route was now\\npainful; lying over ground ragged with rocks, and intersected with\\nravines, and their progress proportionately slow. Bleak and black hills\\nlay on every side of them, compensating in some degree for the\\nadditional toil of the march, by the sense of security they imparted. At\\nlength the party began slowly to climb a steep and rugged ascent by a\\npath that curiously wound among rocks and trees, avoiding the one, and\\nsupported by the other, in a manner that showed it had been devised by\\nmen long practised in the arts of the wilderness. As they gradually rose\\nfrom the level of the valleys, the thick darkness which usually precedes\\nthe approach of day began to disperse, and objects were seen in the\\nplain and palpable colors with which they had been gifted by nature.\\nWhen they issued from the stunted woods which clung to the barren sides\\nof the mountain, upon a flat and mossy rock that formed its summit, they\\nmet the morning, as it came blushing above the green pines of a hill\\nthat lay on the opposite side of the valley of the Horican.\\n\\nThe scout now told the sisters to dismount; and taking the bridles from\\nthe mouths, and the saddles off the backs of the jaded beasts, he turned\\nthem loose, to glean a scanty subsistence among the shrubs and meagre\\nherbage of that elevated region.\\n\\n\"Go,\" he said, \"and seek your food where natur\\' gives it you; and beware\\nthat you become not food to ravenous wolves yourselves, among these\\nhills.\"\\n\\n\"Have we no further need of them?\" demanded Heyward.\\n\\n\"See, and judge with your own eyes,\" said the scout, advancing towards\\nthe eastern brow of the mountain, whither he beckoned for the whole\\nparty to follow; \"if it was as easy to look into the heart of man as it\\nis to spy out the nakedness of Montcalm\\'s camp from this spot,\\nhypocrites would grow scarce, and the cunning of a Mingo might prove a\\nlosing game, compared to the honesty of a Delaware.\"\\n\\nWhen the travellers reached the verge of the precipice, they saw, at a\\nglance, the truth of the scout\\'s declaration, and the admirable\\nforesight with which he had led them to their commanding station.\\n\\nThe mountain on which they stood, elevated, perhaps, a thousand feet in\\nthe air, was a high cone that rose a little in advance of that range\\nwhich stretches for miles along the western shores of the lake, until\\nmeeting its sister piles, beyond the water, it ran off towards the\\nCanadas, in confused and broken masses of rock, thinly sprinkled with\\nevergreens. Immediately at the feet of the party, the southern shore of\\nthe Horican swept in a broad semicircle, from mountain to mountain,\\nmarking a wide strand, that soon rose into an uneven and somewhat\\nelevated plain. To the north stretched the limpid, and, as it appeared\\nfrom that dizzy height, the narrow sheet of the \"holy lake,\" indented\\nwith numberless bays, embellished by fantastic headlands, and dotted\\nwith countless islands. At the distance of a few leagues, the bed of the\\nwaters became lost among mountains, or was wrapped in the masses of\\nvapor that came slowly rolling along their bosom, before a light morning\\nair. But a narrow opening between the crests of the hills pointed out\\nthe passage by which they found their way still farther north, to spread\\ntheir pure and ample sheets again, before pouring out their tribute into\\nthe distant Champlain. To the south stretched the defile, or rather\\nbroken plain, so often mentioned. For several miles in this direction,\\nthe mountains appeared reluctant to yield their dominion, but within\\nreach of the eye they diverged, and finally melted into the level and\\nsandy lands, across which we have accompanied our adventurers in their\\ndouble journey. Along both ranges of hills, which bounded the opposite\\nsides of the lake and valley, clouds of light vapor were rising in\\nspiral wreaths from the uninhabited woods, looking like the smokes of\\nhidden cottages; or rolled lazily down the declivities, to mingle with\\nthe fogs of the lower land. A single, solitary, snow-white cloud floated\\nabove the valley, and marked the spot beneath which lay the silent pool\\nof the \"bloody pond.\"\\n\\nDirectly on the shore of the lake, and nearer to its western than to its\\neastern margin, lay the extensive earthen ramparts and low buildings of\\nWilliam Henry. Two of the sweeping bastions appeared to rest on the\\nwater which washed their bases, while a deep ditch and extensive\\nmorasses guarded its other sides and angles. The land had been cleared\\nof wood for a reasonable distance around the work, but every other part\\nof the scene lay in the green livery of nature, except where the limpid\\nwater mellowed the view, or the bold rocks thrust their black and naked\\nheads above the undulating outline of the mountain ranges. In its front\\nmight be seen the scattered sentinels, who held a weary watch against\\ntheir numerous foes; and within the walls themselves, the travellers\\nlooked down upon men still drowsy with a night of vigilance. Towards the\\nsoutheast, but in immediate contact with the fort, was an entrenched\\ncamp, posted on a rocky eminence, that would have been far more eligible\\nfor the work itself, in which Hawkeye pointed out the presence of those\\nauxiliary regiments that had so recently left the Hudson in their\\ncompany. From the woods, a little farther to the south, rose numerous\\ndark and lurid smokes, that were easily to be distinguished from the\\npurer exhalations of the springs, and which the scout also showed to\\nHeyward, as evidences that the enemy lay in force in that direction.\\n\\nBut the spectacle which most concerned the young soldier was on the\\nwestern bank of the lake, though quite near to its southern termination.\\nOn a strip of land, which appeared, from his stand, too narrow to\\ncontain such an army, but which, in truth, extended many hundreds of\\nyards from the shores of the Horican to the base of the mountain, were\\nto be seen the white tents and military engines of an encampment of ten\\nthousand men. Batteries were already thrown up in their front, and even\\nwhile the spectators above them were looking down, with such different\\nemotions, on a scene which lay like a map beneath their feet, the roar\\nof artillery rose from the valley, and passed off in thundering echoes,\\nalong the eastern hills.\\n\\n\"Morning is just touching them below,\" said the deliberate and musing\\nscout, \"and the watchers have a mind to wake up the sleepers by the\\nsound of cannon. We are a few hours too late? Montcalm has already\\nfilled the woods with his accursed Iroquois.\"\\n\\n\"The place is, indeed, invested,\" returned Duncan, \"but is there no\\nexpedient by which we may enter? capture in the works would be far\\npreferable to falling again into the hands of roving Indians.\"\\n\\n\"See!\" exclaimed the scout, unconsciously directing the attention of\\nCora to the quarters of her own father, \"how that shot has made the\\nstones fly from the side of the commandant\\'s house! Ay! these Frenchers\\nwill pull it to pieces faster than it was put together, solid and thick\\nthough it be.\"\\n\\n\"Heyward, I sicken at the sight of danger that I cannot share,\" said the\\nundaunted, but anxious daughter. \"Let us go to Montcalm, and demand\\nadmission: he dare not deny a child the boon.\"\\n\\n\"You would scarce find the tent of the Frenchman with the hair on your\\nhead,\" said the blunt scout. \"If I had but one of the thousand boats\\nwhich lie empty along that shore, it might be done. Ha! here will soon\\nbe an end of the firing, for yonder comes a fog that will turn day to\\nnight, and make an Indian arrow more dangerous than a moulded cannon.\\nNow, if you are equal to the work, and will follow, I will make a push;\\nfor I long to get down into that camp, if it be only to scatter some\\nMingo dogs that I see lurking in the skirts of yonder thicket of birch.\"\\n\\n\"We are equal,\" said Cora, firmly: \"on such an errand we will follow to\\nany danger.\"\\n\\nThe scout turned to her with a smile of honest and cordial approbation\\nas he answered,--\\n\\n\"I would I had a thousand men, of brawny limbs and quick eyes, that\\nfeared death as little as you! I\\'d send them jabbering Frenchers back\\ninto their den again, afore the week was ended, howling like so many\\nfettered hounds or hungry wolves. But stir,\" he added, turning from her\\nto the rest of the party, \"the fog comes rolling down so fast, we shall\\nhave but just the time to meet it on the plain, and use it as a cover.\\nRemember, if any accident should befall me, to keep the air blowing on\\nyour left cheeks--or rather, follow the Mohicans; they\\'d scent their\\nway, be it in day or be it at night.\"\\n\\nHe then waved his hand for them to follow, and threw himself down the\\nsteep declivity, with free, but careful footsteps. Heyward assisted the\\nsisters to descend, and in a few minutes they were all far down a\\nmountain whose sides they had climbed with so much toil and pain.\\n\\nThe direction taken by Hawkeye soon brought the travellers to the level\\nof the plain, nearly opposite to a sally-port in the western curtain of\\nthe fort, which lay, itself, at the distance of about half a mile from\\nthe point where he halted to allow Duncan to come up with his charge. In\\ntheir eagerness, and favored by the nature of the ground, they had\\nanticipated the fog, which was rolling heavily down the lake, and it\\nbecame necessary to pause, until the mists had wrapped the camp of the\\nenemy in their fleecy mantle. The Mohicans profited by the delay, to\\nsteal out of the woods, and to make a survey of surrounding objects.\\nThey were followed at a little distance by the scout, with a view to\\nprofit early by their report, and to obtain some faint knowledge for\\nhimself of the more immediate localities.\\n\\nIn a very few moments he returned, his face reddened with vexation,\\nwhile he muttered his disappointment in words of no very gentle import.\\n\\n\"Here has the cunning Frenchman been posting a picket directly in our\\npath,\" he said; \"redskins and whites; and we shall be as likely to fall\\ninto their midst as to pass them in the fog!\"\\n\\n\"Cannot we make a circuit to avoid the danger,\" asked Heyward, \"and come\\ninto our path again when it is passed?\"\\n\\n\"Who that once bends from the line of his march in a fog can tell when\\nor how to turn to find it again! The mists of Horican are not like the\\ncurls from a peace-pipe, or the smoke which settles above a mosquito\\nfire.\"\\n\\nHe was yet speaking, when a crashing sound was heard, and a cannon-ball\\nentered the thicket, striking the body of a sapling, and rebounding to\\nthe earth, its force being much expended by previous resistance. The\\nIndians followed instantly like busy attendants on the terrible\\nmessenger, and Uncas commenced speaking earnestly and with much action,\\nin the Delaware tongue.\\n\\n\"It may be so, lad,\" muttered the scout, when he had ended; \"for\\ndesperate fevers are not to be treated like a toothache. Come, then, the\\nfog is shutting in.\"\\n\\n\"Stop!\" cried Heyward; \"first explain your expectations.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis soon done, and a small hope it is; but it is better than nothing.\\nThis shot that you see,\" added the scout, kicking the harmless iron with\\nhis foot, \"has ploughed the \\'arth in its road from the fort, and we\\nshall hunt for the furrow it has made, when all other signs may fail. No\\nmore words, but follow, or the fog may leave us in the middle of our\\npath, a mark for both armies to shoot at.\"\\n\\nHeyward perceiving that, in fact, a crisis had arrived when acts were\\nmore required than words, placed himself between the sisters, and drew\\nthem swiftly forward, keeping the dim figure of their leader in his eye.\\nIt was soon apparent that Hawkeye had not magnified the power of the\\nfog, for before they had proceeded twenty yards, it was difficult for\\nthe different individuals of the party to distinguish each other, in the\\nvapor.\\n\\nThey had made their little circuit to the left, and were already\\ninclining again towards the right, having, as Heyward thought, got over\\nnearly half the distance to the friendly works, when his ears were\\nsaluted with the fierce summons, apparently within twenty feet of them,\\nof--\\n\\n\"Qui va la?\"\\n\\n\"Push on!\" whispered the scout, once more bending to the left.\\n\\n\"Push on!\" repeated Heyward; when the summons was renewed by a dozen\\nvoices, each of which seemed charged with menace.\\n\\n\"C\\'est moi,\" cried Duncan, dragging, rather than leading those he\\nsupported, swiftly onward.\\n\\n\"Bete!--qui?--moi!\"\\n\\n\"Ami de la France.\"\\n\\n\"Tu m\\'as plus l\\'air d\\'un _ennemi_ de la France; arrete! ou pardieu je te\\nferai ami du diable. Non! feu, camarades, feu!\"\\n\\nThe order was instantly obeyed, and the fog was stirred by the explosion\\nof fifty muskets. Happily, the aim was bad, and the bullets cut the air\\nin a direction a little different from that taken by the fugitives;\\nthough still so nigh them, that to the unpractised ears of David and the\\ntwo females, it appeared as if they whistled within a few inches of the\\norgans. The outcry was renewed, and the order, not only to fire again,\\nbut to pursue, was too plainly audible. When Heyward briefly explained\\nthe meaning of the words they heard, Hawkeye halted, and spoke with\\nquick decision and great firmness.\\n\\n\"Let us deliver our fire,\" he said; \"they will believe it a sortie, and\\ngive way, or they will wait for reinforcements.\"\\n\\nThe scheme was well conceived, but failed in its effect. The instant the\\nFrench heard the pieces, it seemed as if the plain was alive with men,\\nmuskets rattling along its whole extent, from the shores of the lake to\\nthe farthest boundary of the woods.\\n\\n\"We shall draw their entire army upon us, and bring on a general\\nassault,\" said Duncan: \"lead on, my friend, for your own life, and\\nours.\"\\n\\nThe scout seemed willing to comply; but, in the hurry of the moment, and\\nin the change of position, he had lost the direction. In vain he turned\\neither cheek towards the light air; they felt equally cool. In this\\ndilemma, Uncas lighted on the furrow of the cannon-ball, where it had\\ncut the ground in three adjacent ant-hills.\\n\\n\"Give me the range!\" said Hawkeye, bending to catch a glimpse of the\\ndirection, and then instantly moving onward.\\n\\nCries, oaths, voices calling to each other, and the reports of muskets,\\nwere now quick and incessant, and, apparently, on every side of them.\\nSuddenly, a strong glare of light flashed across the scene, the fog\\nrolled upwards in thick wreaths, and several cannon belched across the\\nplain, and the roar was thrown heavily back from the bellowing echoes of\\nthe mountain.\\n\\n\"\\'Tis from the fort!\" exclaimed Hawkeye, turning short on his tracks;\\n\"and we, like stricken fools, were rushing to the woods, under the very\\nknives of the Maquas.\"\\n\\nThe instant their mistake was rectified, the whole party retraced the\\nerror with the utmost diligence. Duncan willingly relinquished the\\nsupport of Cora to the arm of Uncas, and Cora as readily accepted the\\nwelcome assistance. Men, hot and angry in pursuit, were evidently on\\ntheir footsteps, and each instant threatened their capture, if not their\\ndestruction.\\n\\n\"Point de quartier aux coquins!\" cried an eager pursuer, who seemed to\\ndirect the operations of the enemy.\\n\\n\"Stand firm, and be ready, my gallant 60ths!\" suddenly exclaimed a voice\\nabove them; \"wait to see the enemy,--fire low, and sweep the glacis.\"\\n\\n\"Father! father!\" exclaimed a piercing cry from out the mist; \"it is I!\\nAlice! thy own Elsie! spare, O! save your daughters!\"\\n\\n\"Hold!\" shouted the former speaker, in the awful tones of parental\\nagony, the sound reaching even to the woods, and rolling back in solemn\\necho. \"\\'Tis she! God has restored me my children! Throw open the\\nsally-port; to the field, 60ths, to the field; pull not a trigger, lest\\nye kill my lambs! Drive off these dogs of France with your steel.\"\\n\\nDuncan heard the grating of the rusty hinges, and darting to the spot,\\ndirected by the sound, he met a long line of dark red warriors, passing\\nswiftly towards the glacis. He knew them for his own battalion of the\\nroyal Americans, and flying to their head, soon swept every trace of his\\npursuers from before the works.\\n\\nFor an instant, Cora and Alice had stood trembling and bewildered by\\nthis unexpected desertion; but, before either had leisure for speech, or\\neven thought, an officer of gigantic frame whose locks were bleached\\nwith years and service, but whose air of military grandeur had been\\nrather softened than destroyed by time, rushed out of the body of the\\nmist, and folded them to his bosom, while large scalding tears rolled\\ndown his pale and wrinkled cheeks, and he exclaimed, in the peculiar\\naccent of Scotland,--\\n\\n\"For this I thank thee, Lord! Let danger come as it will, thy servant is\\nnow prepared!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "    'summary_text': 'Now that the afternoon is shortening, Hawkeye leads the party many toilsome miles to an open space surrounding a low, green hillock crowned by a rude, decayed block-house, the scene of a victorious youthful battle for Chingachgook and the scout. Under the hillock are the long-dead Mohawks, the memory of whom makes Hawkeye once again refer to the two Mohicans as the last of their tribe. All except Chingachgook fall asleep and awaken at the rising of the moon to continue their journey. Before they can leave, they hear the steps of some twenty enemy Indians who have apparently lost their trail. While the protagonists wait in quiet suspense, two Hurons approach the mound but warily withdraw out of respect for the dead. As soon as the sounds of the hunters completely fade away, the seven fugitives silently head north again. After tactically walking barefoot in a stream for an hour, they turn again to the plain and reach the \"bloody pond,\" where in a previous battle Frenchmen had been surprised, slain, and tossed into the water. Being now near the French outposts, they encounter a French sentinel, whom Heyward fools by answering in French and whom Chingachgook slips upon, kills, and scalps. Since they must turn back for safety, Hawkeye leads them up a mountain from which, as morning comes, they can see to the east Fort William Henry on the southern tip of Lake George. Between them and the fort are General Montcalm\\'s ten thousand Frenchmen, while to the southeast is the camped detachment from Fort Edward. Firing has already started, but as a great fog descends, the party plans to push through it to the fort. They have strayed from their way when a cannon ball from the fort rolls to a stop near them and they decide to follow its furrow to safety. Again running into French forces, they have to flee and become lost until Uncas finds the furrow again. They are hotly pursued, but within minutes they are beneath the walls of the fort, where Munro recognizes the voice of Alice and orders his men out the sally-port. Led by Heyward, the English disperse the French as the gigantic, grey-haired Munro, large tears rolling down his cheeks, embraces his two daughters in his arms.',\n",
       "    'summary_analysis': 'The story has now reached the end of the first long chase, during which one pattern of pursuit-capture-escape-and-pursuit is completed. But Cooper has made sure that the present safety for the main characters is only relative. He has made the reader aware that the defending English are far outnumbered and contained by the ten thousand French and their Indian allies; even the sentimental reader who may feel relief and a gush of emotional release at the reunion of the father and daughters knows that the protagonists now face the double danger of foes and can no longer maneuver as they did in the forests. If any lull is to come, it will be in terms of action, not suspense. The action here is so intense that little individual characterization is presented. Gamut is barely present, and Uncas apparently has no chance to show his interest in Cora. At one point Hawkeye relates some of the history of the tribe of Mohicans, and his reference to his two companions keeps alive the background theme of tribal demise. But rather than its setting him apart as an individual, Chingachgook\\'s taking of scalps merely shows how much he still has in common with all other Indians, though his actions do stand in contrast to Uncas\\' behavior in the preceding chapter. Hawkeye, who sees Chingachgook\\'s actions as part of his Indian \"gift,\" evinces one new character element with his superstition at the \"bloody pond.\" However, since Cooper is busy rounding out his action, he does not dwell on theme or characterization in these moments.',\n",

Though it is the last war that England and France waged for a country that neither would retain, the wilderness between the forces still has to be overcome first. Thus it is in 1757, in the New York area between the head waters of the Hudson River and Lake George to the north. Because only two years earlier General Braddock was disgracefully routed by a handful of French and Indians, the frontier is now exposed to real and imaginary savage disasters as well as to the horrors of warfare. Fear has replaced reason. Near dusk of a day in July, an Indian runner named Magua arrives at Fort Edward on the upper Hudson. He has come from Fort William Henry at the southern tip of Lake George with the news that the French General Montcalm is moving south with a very large army and that Munro, commander of Fort William Henry, is in urgent need of plentiful reinforcements from General Webb. Early the next morning, a limited detachment of fifteen hundred regulars and colonists departs as if swallowed by the forest. Shortly afterwards, Major Duncan Heyward and Alice and Cora Munro, guided by Magua on foot, take by horseback a secret route toward William Henry for the girls to join their father. Blonde Alice is doubtful about Magua, covered with war paint and showing a sullen fierceness; but dark-haired Cora is stoically common sense about him, even though Heyward mentions that their father had once had to deal rigidly with the Indian. As the small party pushes on, they are overtaken by David Gamut, a tall, ungainly psalmodist ridiculously dressed and carrying a pitch pipe while riding a mare followed by its young colt. He desires to join them, and after some banter between him and Alice, he pulls out the twenty-sixth edition of The Bay Psalm Book, sounds his pipe, and renders a song \\\\\"in full, sweet, and melodious tones.\\\\\" At a muttered comment from Magua, Heyward insists upon silence for safety. Then he glances about them and, satisfied that he has seen only shining berries, smiles to himself as they move on. But he is wrong. The branches move and a man peers exultingly after them as they disappear among the dark lines of trees.\", \"analysis\": \"These two chapters introduce the reader to the historical and natural settings and are indicative of the extent to which this book, as a historical novel, relates its fictional characters to real history. Only here at the beginning and later at mid-novel will the action coincide in detail with actual events, though the historic war is always somewhere in the near distance. These chapters also present four of the main fictional characters and one secondary one, all of whom will merit our concern henceforth. Major Heyward is the gallant romantic hero, but unlike most sentimental romances where for each hero there is one heroine, here there are two, Alice and Cora, blonde and brunette. And it is immediately apparent that the old tradition of weak-blonde-strong-brunette contrast is at work, stereotyping the fair Alice and dark Cora. These three are rather predictable types which both simplify and stultify the writer\\'s efforts with them. Magua\\'s stealthy eyes and abrupt, furtive actions mark him as a potential villain, while the exaggerated presentation of the simple, single-minded Gamut paints him as the comic and perhaps pitiable adult innocent. At this point, both are something less than realistic and fully vitalized characters, but in comparison to the other three they seem to breathe real air. The stature of originality and verisimilitude that they do show is doubtless due to the fact that they are native characters. One may note, for instance, that Heyward\\'s comment about Munro\\'s once dealing rigidly with Magua not only lends suspense to the situation and points to the theme of revenge but also suggests some depth of motivation for the Indian. What we call plot -- the complications of a situation and the subsequent events and actions that further entangle things before they are finally resolved in some fashion -- starts an early ferment in terms of danger and suspense. Four likable and somewhat innocent characters strike into the unknown forest wilderness with a doubtful guide. It is a time of urgency, and movement is swift. Cooper hardly gives the reader time to question seriously why Munro\\'s daughters would push forward their visit at this worst of times and would feel themselves safer almost alone on a dim path in savage-infested territory than in the company of fifteen hundred trained fighting men. This represents a lack in character motivation, but Cooper knows that he must get his people into jeopardy, and he at least partly succeeds in hiding this lack under suspenseful action and a sense of urgency. But in spite of the pace, Cooper also manages a good instance of dramatic irony, a fictional presentation in which the reader is allowed to see or deduce predicaments unknown or only partly known by the characters. It is thus that the first part of the pattern of action -- that of pursuit -- has begun.\"}',\n",
       "   'chapter': '\\n  \"Mine ear is open, and my heart prepared:\\n  The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold:\\n  Say, is my kingdom lost?\"\\n\\n  SHAKESPEARE.\\n\\n\\nIt was a feature peculiar to the colonial wars of North America, that\\nthe toils and dangers of the wilderness were to be encountered before\\nthe adverse hosts could meet. A wide and apparently an impervious\\nboundary of forests severed the possessions of the hostile provinces of\\nFrance and England. The hardy colonist, and the trained European who\\nfought at his side, frequently expended months in struggling against the\\nrapids of the streams, or in effecting the rugged passes of the\\nmountains, in quest of an opportunity to exhibit their courage in a more\\nmartial conflict. But, emulating the patience and self-denial of the\\npractised native warriors, they learned to overcome every difficulty;\\nand it would seem that, in time, there was no recess of the woods so\\ndark, nor any secret place so lovely, that it might claim exemption from\\nthe inroads of those who had pledged their blood to satiate their\\nvengeance, or to uphold the cold and selfish policy of the distant\\nmonarchs of Europe.\\n\\nPerhaps no district throughout the wide extent of the intermediate\\nfrontiers can furnish a livelier picture of the cruelty and fierceness\\nof the savage warfare of those periods than the country which lies\\nbetween the head waters of the Hudson and the adjacent lakes.\\n\\nThe facilities which nature had there offered to the march of the\\ncombatants were too obvious to be neglected. The lengthened sheet of the\\nChamplain stretched from the frontiers of Canada, deep within the\\nborders of the neighboring province of New York, forming a natural\\npassage across half the distance that the French were compelled to\\nmaster in order to strike their enemies. Near its southern termination,\\nit received the contributions of another lake, whose waters were so\\nlimpid as to have been exclusively selected by the Jesuit missionaries\\nto perform the typical purification of baptism, and to obtain for it the\\ntitle of lake \"du Saint Sacrement.\" The less zealous English thought\\nthey conferred a sufficient honor on its unsullied fountains, when they\\nbestowed the name of their reigning prince, the second of the house of\\nHanover. The two united to rob the untutored possessors of its wooded\\nscenery of their native right to perpetuate its original appellation of\\n\"Horican.\"[1]\\n\\nWinding its way among countless islands, and imbedded in mountains, the\\n\"holy lake\" extended a dozen leagues still farther to the south. With\\nthe high plain that there interposed itself to the further passage of\\nthe water, commenced a portage of as many miles, which conducted the\\nadventurer to the banks of the Hudson, at a point where, with the usual\\nobstructions of the rapids, or rifts, as they were then termed in the\\nlanguage of the country, the river became navigable to the tide.\\n\\nWhile, in the pursuit of their daring plans of annoyance, the restless\\nenterprise of the French even attempted the distant and difficult gorges\\nof the Alleghany, it may easily be imagined that their proverbial\\nacuteness would not overlook the natural advantages of the district we\\nhave just described. It became, emphatically, the bloody arena, in which\\nmost of the battles for the mastery of the colonies were contested.\\nForts were erected at the different points that commanded the facilities\\nof the route, and were taken and retaken, razed and rebuilt, as victory\\nalighted on the hostile banners. While the husbandman shrank back from\\nthe dangerous passes, within the safer boundaries of the more ancient\\nsettlements, armies larger than those that had often disposed of the\\nsceptres of the mother countries, were seen to bury themselves in these\\nforests, whence they rarely returned but in skeleton bands, that were\\nhaggard with care, or dejected by defeat. Though the arts of peace were\\nunknown to this fatal region, its forests were alive with men; its\\nshades and glens rang with the sounds of martial music, and the echoes\\nof its mountains threw back the laugh, or repeated the wanton cry, of\\nmany a gallant and reckless youth, as he hurried by them, in the\\nnoontide of his spirits, to slumber in a long night of forgetfulness.\\n\\nIt was in this scene of strife and bloodshed that the incidents we shall\\nattempt to relate occurred, during the third year of the war which\\nEngland and France last waged for the possession of a country that\\nneither was destined to retain.\\n\\nThe imbecility of her military leaders abroad, and the fatal want of\\nenergy in her councils at home, had lowered the character of Great\\nBritain from the proud elevation on which it had been placed, by the\\ntalents and enterprise of her former warriors and statesmen. No longer\\ndreaded by her enemies, her servants were fast losing the confidence of\\nself-respect. In this mortifying abasement, the colonists, though\\ninnocent of her imbecility, and too humble to be the agents of her\\nblunders, were but the natural participators.\\n\\nThey had recently seen a chosen army from that country, which,\\nreverencing as a mother, they had blindly believed invincible--an army\\nled by a chief who had been selected from a crowd of trained warriors,\\nfor his rare military endowments, disgracefully routed by a handful of\\nFrench and Indians, and only saved from annihilation by the coolness and\\nspirit of a Virginian boy, whose riper fame has since diffused itself,\\nwith the steady influence of moral truth, to the uttermost confines of\\nChristendom.[2] A wide frontier had been laid naked by this unexpected\\ndisaster, and more substantial evils were preceded by a thousand\\nfanciful and imaginary dangers. The alarmed colonists believed that the\\nyells of the savages mingled with every fitful gust of wind that issued\\nfrom the interminable forests of the west. The terrific character of\\ntheir merciless enemies increased immeasurably the natural horrors of\\nwarfare. Numberless recent massacres were still vivid in their\\nrecollections; nor was there any ear in the provinces so deaf as not to\\nhave drunk in with avidity the narrative of some fearful tale of\\nmidnight murder, in which the natives of the forests were the principal\\nand barbarous actors. As the credulous and excited traveller related the\\nhazardous chances of the wilderness, the blood of the timid curdled\\nwith terror, and mothers cast anxious glances even at those children\\nwhich slumbered within the security of the largest towns. In short, the\\nmagnifying influence of fear began to set at naught the calculations of\\nreason, and to render those who should have remembered their manhood,\\nthe slaves of the basest of passions. Even the most confident and the\\nstoutest hearts began to think the issue of the contest was becoming\\ndoubtful; and that abject class was hourly increasing in numbers, who\\nthought they foresaw all the possessions of the English crown in America\\nsubdued by their Christian foes, or laid waste by the inroads of their\\nrelentless allies.\\n\\nWhen, therefore, intelligence was received at the fort, which covered\\nthe southern termination of the portage between the Hudson and the\\nlakes, that Montcalm had been seen moving up the Champlain, with an army\\n\"numerous as the leaves on the trees,\" its truth was admitted with more\\nof the craven reluctance of fear than with the stern joy that a warrior\\nshould feel, in finding an enemy within reach of his blow. The news had\\nbeen brought, towards the decline of a day in midsummer, by an Indian\\nrunner, who also bore an urgent request from Munro, the commander of a\\nwork on the shore of the \"holy lake,\" for a speedy and powerful\\nreinforcement. It has already been mentioned that the distance between\\nthese two posts was less than five leagues. The rude path, which\\noriginally formed their line of communication, had been widened for the\\npassage of wagons; so that the distance which had been travelled by the\\nson of the forest in two hours, might easily be effected by a detachment\\nof troops, with their necessary baggage, between the rising and setting\\nof a summer sun. The loyal servants of the British crown had given to\\none of these forest fastnesses the name of William Henry, and to the\\nother that of Fort Edward; calling each after a favorite prince of the\\nreigning family. The veteran Scotchman just named held the first, with a\\nregiment of regulars and a few provincials; a force really by far too\\nsmall to make head against the formidable power that Montcalm was\\nleading to the foot of his earthen mounds. At the latter, however, lay\\nGeneral Webb, who commanded the armies of the king in the northern\\nprovinces, with a body of more than five thousand men. By uniting the\\nseveral detachments of his command, this officer might have arrayed\\nnearly double that number of combatants against the enterprising\\nFrenchman, who had ventured so far from his reinforcements, with an army\\nbut little superior in numbers.\\n\\nBut under the influence of their degraded fortunes, both officers and\\nmen appeared better disposed to await the approach of their formidable\\nantagonists, within their works, than to resist the progress of their\\nmarch, by emulating the successful example of the French at Fort du\\nQuesne, and striking a blow on their advance.\\n\\nAfter the first surprise of the intelligence had a little abated, a\\nrumor was spread through the entrenched camp, which stretched along the\\nmargin of the Hudson, forming a chain of outworks to the body of the\\nfort itself, that a chosen detachment of fifteen hundred men was to\\ndepart, with the dawn, for William Henry, the post at the northern\\nextremity of the portage. That which at first was only rumor, soon\\nbecame certainty, as orders passed from the quarters of the\\ncommander-in-chief to the several corps he had selected for this\\nservice, to prepare for their speedy departure. All doubt as to the\\nintention of Webb now vanished, and an hour or two of hurried footsteps\\nand anxious faces succeeded. The novice in the military art flew from\\npoint to point, retarding his own preparations by the excess of his\\nviolent and somewhat distempered zeal; while the more practised veteran\\nmade his arrangements with a deliberation that scorned every appearance\\nof haste; though his sober lineaments and anxious eye sufficiently\\nbetrayed that he had no very strong professional relish for the as yet\\nuntried and dreaded warfare of the wilderness. At length the sun set in\\na flood of glory, behind the distant western hills, and as darkness drew\\nits veil around the secluded spot the sounds of preparation diminished;\\nthe last light finally disappeared from the log cabin of some officer;\\nthe trees cast their deeper shadows over the mounds and the rippling\\nstream, and a silence soon pervaded the camp, as deep as that which\\nreigned in the vast forest by which it was environed.\\n\\nAccording to the orders of the preceding night, the heavy sleep of the\\narmy was broken by the rolling of the warning drums, whose rattling\\nechoes were heard issuing, on the damp morning air, out of every vista\\nof the woods, just as day began to draw the shaggy outlines of some tall\\npines of the vicinity, on the opening brightness of a soft and cloudless\\neastern sky. In an instant the whole camp was in motion; the meanest\\nsoldier arousing from his lair to witness the departure of his\\ncomrades, and to share in the excitement and incidents of the hour. The\\nsimple array of the chosen band was soon completed. While the regular\\nand trained hirelings of the king marched with haughtiness to the right\\nof the line, the less pretending colonists took their humbler position\\non its left, with a docility that long practice had rendered easy. The\\nscouts departed; strong guards preceded and followed the lumbering\\nvehicles that bore the baggage; and before the gray light of the morning\\nwas mellowed by the rays of the sun, the main body of the combatants\\nwheeled into column, and left the encampment with a show of high\\nmilitary bearing, that served to drown the slumbering apprehensions of\\nmany a novice, who was now about to make his first essay in arms. While\\nin view of their admiring comrades, the same proud front and ordered\\narray was observed, until the notes of their fifes growing fainter in\\ndistance, the forest at length appeared to swallow up the living mass\\nwhich had slowly entered its bosom.\\n\\nThe deepest sounds of the retiring and invisible column had ceased to be\\nborne on the breeze to the listeners, and the latest straggler had\\nalready disappeared in pursuit; but there still remained the signs of\\nanother departure, before a log cabin of unusual size and\\naccommodations, in front of which those sentinels paced their rounds,\\nwho were known to guard the person of the English general. At this spot\\nwere gathered some half dozen horses, caparisoned in a manner which\\nshowed that two, at least, were destined to bear the persons of females,\\nof a rank that it was not usual to meet so far in the wilds of the\\ncountry. A third wore the trappings and arms of an officer of the staff;\\nwhile the rest, from the plainness of the housings, and the travelling\\nmails with which they were encumbered, were evidently fitted for the\\nreception of as many menials, who were, seemingly, already awaiting the\\npleasure of those they served. At a respectful distance from this\\nunusual show were gathered divers groups of curious idlers; some\\nadmiring the blood and bone of the high-mettled military charger, and\\nothers gazing at the preparations, with dull wonder of vulgar curiosity.\\nThere was one man, however, who, by his countenance and actions, formed\\na marked exception to those who composed the latter class of spectators,\\nbeing neither idle, nor seemingly very ignorant.\\n\\nThe person of this individual was to the last degree ungainly, without\\nbeing in any particular manner deformed. He had all the bones and joints\\nof other men, without any of their proportions. Erect, his stature\\nsurpassed that of his fellows; seated, he appeared reduced within the\\nordinary limits of the race. The same contrariety in his members seemed\\nto exist throughout the whole man. His head was large; his shoulders\\nnarrow; his arms long and dangling; while his hands were small, if not\\ndelicate. His legs and thighs were thin, nearly to emaciation, but of\\nextraordinary length; and his knees would have been considered\\ntremendous, had they not been outdone by the broader foundations on\\nwhich this false superstructure of the blended human orders was so\\nprofanely reared. The ill-assorted and injudicious attire of the\\nindividual only served to render his awkwardness more conspicuous. A\\nsky-blue coat, with short and broad skirts and low cape, exposed a long\\nthin neck, and longer and thinner legs, to the worst animadversions of\\nthe evil disposed. His nether garment was of yellow nankeen, closely\\nfitted to the shape, and tied at his bunches of knees by large knots of\\nwhite ribbon, a good deal sullied by use. Clouded cotton stockings, and\\nshoes, on one of the latter of which was a plated spur, completed the\\ncostume of the lower extremity of this figure, no curve or angle of\\nwhich was concealed, but, on the other hand, studiously exhibited,\\nthrough the vanity or simplicity of its owner. From beneath the flap of\\nan enormous pocket of a soiled vest of embossed silk, heavily ornamented\\nwith tarnished silver lace, projected an instrument, which, from being\\nseen in such martial company, might have been easily mistaken for some\\nmischievous and unknown implement of war. Small as it was, this uncommon\\nengine had excited the curiosity of most of the Europeans in the camp,\\nthough several of the provincials were seen to handle it, not only\\nwithout fear, but with the utmost familiarity. A large, civil cocked\\nhat, like those worn by clergymen within the last thirty years,\\nsurmounted the whole, furnishing dignity to a good-natured and somewhat\\nvacant countenance, that apparently needed such artificial aid, to\\nsupport the gravity of some high and extraordinary trust.\\n\\nWhile the common herd stood aloof, in deference to the quarters of Webb,\\nthe figure we have described stalked in the centre of the domestics,\\nfreely expressing his censures or commendations on the merits of the\\nhorses, as by chance they displeased or satisfied his judgment.\\n\\n\"This beast, I rather conclude, friend, is not of home raising, but is\\nfrom foreign lands, or perhaps from the little island itself over the\\nblue water?\" he said, in a voice as remarkable for the softness and\\nsweetness of its tones, as was his person for its rare proportions: \"I\\nmay speak of these things, and be no braggart; for I have been down at\\nboth havens; that which is situate at the mouth of Thames, and is named\\nafter the capital of Old England, and that which is called \\'Haven,\\' with\\nthe addition of the word \\'New\\'; and have seen the snows and brigantines\\ncollecting their droves, like the gathering to the ark, being outward\\nbound to the Island of Jamaica, for the purpose of barter and traffic in\\nfour-footed animals; but never before have I beheld a beast which\\nverified the true Scripture war-horse like this: \\'He paweth in the\\nvalley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth on to meet the armed\\nmen. He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle\\nafar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.\\' It would seem\\nthat the stock of the horse of Israel has descended to our own time;\\nwould it not, friend?\"\\n\\nReceiving no reply to this extraordinary appeal, which in truth, as it\\nwas delivered with the vigor of full and sonorous tones, merited some\\nsort of notice, he who had thus sung forth the language of the Holy Book\\nturned to the silent figure to whom he had unwittingly addressed\\nhimself, and found a new and more powerful subject of admiration in the\\nobject that encountered his gaze. His eyes fell on the still, upright,\\nand rigid form of the \"Indian runner,\" who had borne to the camp the\\nunwelcome tidings of the preceding evening. Although in a state of\\nperfect repose, and apparently disregarding, with characteristic\\nstoicism, the excitement and bustle around him, there was a sullen\\nfierceness mingled with the quiet of the savage, that was likely to\\narrest the attention of much more experienced eyes than those which now\\nscanned him, in unconcealed amazement. The native bore both the tomahawk\\nand knife of his tribe; and yet his appearance was not altogether that\\nof a warrior. On the contrary, there was an air of neglect about his\\nperson, like that which might have proceeded from great and recent\\nexertion, which he had not yet found leisure to repair. The colors of\\nthe war-paint had blended in dark confusion about his fierce\\ncountenance, and rendered his swarthy lineaments still more savage and\\nrepulsive than if art had attempted an effect which had been thus\\nproduced by chance. His eye, alone, which glistened like a fiery star\\namid lowering clouds, was to be seen in its state of native wildness.\\nFor a single instant, his searching and yet wary glance met the\\nwondering look of the other, and then changing its direction, partly in\\ncunning, and partly in disdain, it remained fixed, as if penetrating the\\ndistant air.\\n\\nIt is impossible to say what unlooked-for remark this short and silent\\ncommunication, between two such singular men, might have elicited from\\nthe white man, had not his active curiosity been again drawn to other\\nobjects. A general movement among the domestics, and a low sound of\\ngentle voices, announced the approach of those whose presence alone was\\nwanted to enable the cavalcade to move. The simple admirer of the\\nwar-horse instantly fell back to a low, gaunt, switch-tailed mare, that\\nwas unconsciously gleaning the faded herbage of the camp nigh by; where,\\nleaning with one elbow on the blanket that concealed an apology for a\\nsaddle, he became a spectator of the departure, while a foal was quietly\\nmaking its morning repast, on the opposite side of the same animal.\\n\\nA young man, in the dress of an officer, conducted to their steeds two\\nfemales, who, as it was apparent by their dresses, were prepared to\\nencounter the fatigues of a journey in the woods. One, and she was the\\nmost juvenile in her appearance, though both were young, permitted\\nglimpses of her dazzling complexion, fair golden hair, and bright blue\\neyes, to be caught, as she artlessly suffered the morning air to blow\\naside the green veil which descended low from her beaver. The flush\\nwhich still lingered above the pines in the western sky was not more\\nbright nor delicate than the bloom on her cheek; nor was the opening day\\nmore cheering than the animated smile which she bestowed on the youth,\\nas he assisted her into the saddle. The other, who appeared to share\\nequally in the attentions of the young officer, concealed her charms\\nfrom the gaze of the soldiery, with a care that seemed better fitted to\\nthe experience of four or five additional years. It could be seen,\\nhowever, that her person, though moulded with the same exquisite\\nproportions, of which none of the graces were lost by the travelling\\ndress she wore, was rather fuller and more mature than that of her\\ncompanion.\\n\\nNo sooner were these females seated, than their attendant sprang lightly\\ninto the saddle of the war-horse, when the whole three bowed to Webb,\\nwho, in courtesy, awaited their parting on the threshold of his cabin,\\nand turning their horses\\' heads, they proceeded at a slow amble,\\nfollowed by their train, towards the northern entrance of the\\nencampment. As they traversed that short distance, not a voice was\\nheard amongst them; but a slight exclamation proceeded from the younger\\nof the females, as the Indian runner glided by her, unexpectedly, and\\nled the way along the military road in her front. Though this sudden and\\nstartling movement of the Indian produced no sound from the other, in\\nthe surprise her veil also was allowed to open its folds, and betrayed\\nan indescribable look of pity, admiration, and horror, as her dark eye\\nfollowed the easy motions of the savage. The tresses of this lady were\\nshining and black, like the plumage of the raven. Her complexion was not\\nbrown, but it rather appeared charged with the color of the rich blood,\\nthat seemed ready to burst its bounds. And yet there was neither\\ncoarseness nor want of shadowing in a countenance that was exquisitely\\nregular and dignified, and surpassingly beautiful. She smiled, as if in\\npity at her own momentary forgetfulness, discovering by the act a row of\\nteeth that would have shamed the purest ivory; when, replacing the veil,\\nshe bowed her face, and rode in silence, like one whose thoughts were\\nabstracted from the scene around her.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \"Sola, sola, wo, ha, ho, sola!\"\\n\\n  SHAKESPEARE.\\n\\n\\nWhile one of the lovely beings we have so cursorily presented to the\\nreader was thus lost in thought, the other quickly recovered from the\\nalarm which induced the exclamation, and, laughing at her own weakness,\\nshe inquired of the youth who rode by her side,--\\n\\n\"Are such spectres frequent in the woods, Heyward; or is this sight an\\nespecial entertainment on our behalf? If the latter, gratitude must\\nclose our mouths; but if the former, both Cora and I shall have need to\\ndraw largely on that stock of hereditary courage which we boast, even\\nbefore we are made to encounter the redoubtable Montcalm.\"\\n\\n\"Yon Indian is a \\'runner\\' of the army; and, after the fashion of his\\npeople, he may be accounted a hero,\" returned the officer. \"He has\\nvolunteered to guide us to the lake, by a path but little known, sooner\\nthan if we followed the tardy movements of the column: and, by\\nconsequence, more agreeably.\"\\n\\n\"I like him not,\" said the lady, shuddering, partly in assumed, yet more\\nin real terror. \"You know him, Duncan, or you would not trust yourself\\nso freely to his keeping?\"\\n\\n\"Say, rather, Alice, that I would not trust you. I do know him, or he\\nwould not have my confidence, and least of all at this moment. He is\\nsaid to be a Canadian, too; and yet he served with our friends the\\nMohawks, who, as you know, are one of the six allied nations.[3] He was\\nbrought among us, as I have heard, by some strange accident in which\\nyour father was interested, and in which the savage was rigidly dealt\\nby--but I forget the idle tale; it is enough, that he is now our\\nfriend.\"\\n\\n\"If he has been my father\\'s enemy, I like him still less!\" exclaimed the\\nnow really anxious girl. \"Will you not speak to him, Major Heyward, that\\nI may hear his tones? Foolish though it may be, you have often heard me\\navow my faith in the tones of the human voice!\"\\n\\n\"It would be in vain; and answered, most probably, by an ejaculation.\\nThough he may understand it, he affects, like most of his people, to be\\nignorant of the English; and least of all will he condescend to speak\\nit, now that war demands the utmost exercise of his dignity. But he\\nstops; the private path by which we are to journey is, doubtless, at\\nhand.\"\\n\\nThe conjecture of Major Heyward was true. When they reached the spot\\nwhere the Indian stood, pointing into the thicket that fringed the\\nmilitary road, a narrow and blind path, which might, with some little\\ninconvenience, receive one person at a time, became visible.\\n\\n\"Here, then, lies our way,\" said the young man, in a low voice.\\n\"Manifest no distrust, or you may invite the danger you appear to\\napprehend.\"\\n\\n\"Cora, what think you?\" asked the reluctant fair one. \"If we journey\\nwith the troops, though we may find their presence irksome, shall we not\\nfeel better assurance of our safety?\"\\n\\n\"Being little accustomed to the practices of the savages, Alice, you\\nmistake the place of real danger,\" said Heyward. \"If enemies have\\nreached the portage at all, a thing by no means probable, as our scouts\\nare abroad, they will surely be found skirting the column where scalps\\nabound the most. The route of the detachment is known, while ours,\\nhaving been determined within the hour, must still be secret.\"\\n\\n\"Should we distrust the man because his manners are not our manners, and\\nthat his skin is dark?\" coldly asked Cora.\\n\\nAlice hesitated no longer; but giving her Narragansett[4] a smart cut\\nof the whip, she was the first to dash aside the slight branches of the\\nbushes, and to follow the runner along the dark and tangled pathway. The\\nyoung man regarded the last speaker in open admiration, and even\\npermitted her fairer though certainly not more beautiful companion to\\nproceed unattended, while he sedulously opened the way himself for the\\npassage of her who has been called Cora. It would seem that the\\ndomestics had been previously instructed; for, instead of penetrating\\nthe thicket, they followed the route of the column; a measure which\\nHeyward stated had been dictated by the sagacity of their guide, in\\norder to diminish the marks of their trail, if, haply, the Canadian\\nsavages should be lurking so far in advance of their army. For many\\nminutes the intricacy of the route admitted of no further dialogue;\\nafter which they emerged from the broad border of underbrush which grew\\nalong the line of the highway, and entered under the high but dark\\narches of the forest. Here their progress was less interrupted, and the\\ninstant the guide perceived that the females could command their steeds,\\nhe moved on, at a pace between a trot and a walk, and at a rate which\\nkept the sure-footed and peculiar animals they rode, at a fast yet easy\\namble. The youth had turned to speak to the dark-eyed Cora, when the\\ndistant sound of horses\\' hoofs, clattering over the roots of the broken\\nway in his rear, caused him to check his charger; and, as his companions\\ndrew their reins at the same instant, the whole party came to a halt, in\\norder to obtain an explanation of the unlooked-for interruption.\\n\\nIn a few moments a colt was seen gliding, like a fallow-deer, among the\\nstraight trunks of the pines; and, in another instant, the person of the\\nungainly man described in the preceding chapter, came into view, with as\\nmuch rapidity as he could excite his meagre beast to endure without\\ncoming to an open rupture. Until now this personage had escaped the\\nobservation of the travellers. If he possessed the power to arrest any\\nwandering eye when exhibiting the glories of his altitude on foot, his\\nequestrian graces were still more likely to attract attention.\\nNotwithstanding a constant application of his one armed heel to the\\nflanks of the mare, the most confirmed gait that he could establish was\\na Canterbury gallop with the hind legs, in which those more forward\\nassisted for doubtful moments, though generally content to maintain a\\nloping trot. Perhaps the rapidity of the changes from one of these paces\\nto the other created an optical illusion, which might thus magnify the\\npowers of the beast; for it is certain that Heyward, who possessed a\\ntrue eye for the merits of a horse, was unable, with his utmost\\ningenuity, to decide by what sort of movement his pursuer worked his\\nsinuous way on his footsteps with such persevering hardihood.\\n\\nThe industry and movements of the rider were not less remarkable than\\nthose of the ridden. At each change in the evolutions of the latter, the\\nformer raised his tall person in the stirrups; producing, in this\\nmanner, by the undue elongation of his legs, such sudden growths and\\ndiminishings of the stature, as baffled every conjecture that might be\\nmade as to his dimensions. If to this be added the fact that, in\\nconsequence of the ex parte application of the spur, one side of the\\nmare appeared to journey faster than the other; and that the aggrieved\\nflank was resolutely indicated by unremitted flourishes of a bushy tail,\\nwe finish the picture of both horse and man.\\n\\nThe frown which had gathered around the handsome, open, and manly brow\\nof Heyward, gradually relaxed, and his lips curled into a slight smile,\\nas he regarded the stranger. Alice made no very powerful effort to\\ncontrol her merriment; and even the dark, thoughtful eye of Cora lighted\\nwith a humor that, it would seem, the habit, rather than the nature of\\nits mistress repressed.\\n\\n\"Seek you any here?\" demanded Heyward, when the other had arrived\\nsufficiently nigh to abate his speed; \"I trust you are no messenger of\\nevil tidings?\"\\n\\n\"Even so,\" replied the stranger, making diligent use of his triangular\\ncastor, to produce a circulation in the close air of the woods, and\\nleaving his hearers in doubt to which of the young man\\'s questions he\\nresponded; when, however, he had cooled his face, and recovered his\\nbreath, he continued, \"I hear you are riding to William Henry; as I am\\njourneying thitherward myself, I concluded good company would seem\\nconsistent to the wishes of both parties.\"\\n\\n\"You appear to possess the privilege of a casting vote,\" returned\\nHeyward; \"we are three, whilst you have consulted no one but yourself.\"\\n\\n\"Even so. The first point to be obtained is to know one\\'s own mind. Once\\nsure of that, and where women are concerned, it is not easy, the next\\nis, to act up to the decision. I have endeavored to do both, and here I\\nam.\"\\n\\n\"If you journey to the lake, you have mistaken your route,\" said\\nHeyward, haughtily; \"the highway thither is at least half a mile behind\\nyou.\"\\n\\n\"Even so,\" returned the stranger, nothing daunted by this cold\\nreception; \"I have tarried at \\'Edward\\' a week, and I should be dumb not\\nto have inquired the road I was to journey; and if dumb there would be\\nan end to my calling.\" After simpering in a small way, like one whose\\nmodesty prohibited a more open expression of his admiration of a\\nwitticism that was perfectly unintelligible to his hearers, he\\ncontinued: \"It is not prudent for any one of my profession to be too\\nfamiliar with those he is to instruct; for which reason I follow not the\\nline of the army; besides which, I conclude that a gentleman of your\\ncharacter has the best judgment in matters of wayfaring; I have\\ntherefore decided to join company, in order that the ride may be made\\nagreeable, and partake of social communion.\"\\n\\n\"A most arbitrary, if not a hasty decision!\" exclaimed Heyward,\\nundecided whether to give vent to his growing anger, or to laugh in the\\nother\\'s face. \"But you speak of instruction, and of a profession; are\\nyou an adjunct to the provincial corps, as a master of the noble science\\nof defence and offence; or, perhaps, you are one who draws lines and\\nangles, under the pretence of expounding the mathematics?\"\\n\\nThe stranger regarded his interrogator a moment, in wonder; and then,\\nlosing every mark of self-satisfaction in an expression of solemn\\nhumility, he answered:--\\n\\n\"Of offence, I hope there is none, to either party: of defence, I make\\nnone--by God\\'s good mercy, having committed no palpable sin since last\\nentreating his pardoning grace. I understand not your allusions about\\nlines and angles; and I leave expounding to those who have been called\\nand set apart for that holy office. I lay claim to no higher gift than a\\nsmall insight into the glorious art of petitioning and thanksgiving, as\\npractised in psalmody.\"\\n\\n\"The man is, most manifestly, a disciple of Apollo,\" cried the amused\\nAlice, \"and I take him under my own especial protection. Nay, throw\\naside that frown, Heyward, and in pity to my longing ears, suffer him to\\njourney in our train. Besides,\" she added, in a low and hurried voice,\\ncasting a glance at the distant Cora, who slowly followed the footsteps\\nof their silent but sullen guide, \"it may be a friend added to our\\nstrength, in time of need.\"\\n\\n\"Think you, Alice, that I would trust those I love by this secret path,\\ndid I imagine such need could happen?\"\\n\\n\"Nay, nay, I think not of it now; but this strange man amuses me; and if\\nhe \\'hath music in his soul,\\' let us not churlishly reject his company.\"\\nShe pointed persuasively along the path with her riding-whip, while\\ntheir eyes met in a look which the young man lingered a moment to\\nprolong; then yielding to her gentle influence, he clapped his spurs\\ninto his charger, and in a few bounds was again at the side of Cora.\\n\\n\"I am glad to encounter thee, friend,\" continued the maiden, waving her\\nhand to the stranger to proceed, as she urged her Narragansett to renew\\nits amble. \"Partial relatives have almost persuaded me that I am not\\nentirely worthless in a duet myself; and we may enliven our wayfaring by\\nindulging in our favorite pursuit. It might be of signal advantage to\\none, ignorant as I, to hear the opinions and experience of a master in\\nthe art.\"\\n\\n\"It is refreshing both to the spirits and to the body to indulge in\\npsalmody, in befitting seasons,\" returned the master of song,\\nunhesitatingly complying with her intimation to follow; \"and nothing\\nwould relieve the mind more than such a consoling communion. But four\\nparts are altogether necessary to the perfection of melody. You have all\\nthe manifestations of a soft and rich treble; I can, by especial aid,\\ncarry a full tenor to the highest letter; but we lack counter and bass!\\nYon officer of the king, who hesitated to admit me to his company, might\\nfill the latter, if one may judge from the intonations of his voice in\\ncommon dialogue.\"\\n\\n\"Judge not too rashly from hasty and deceptive appearances,\" said the\\nlady, smiling; \"though Major Heyward can assume such deep notes on\\noccasion, believe me, his natural tones are better fitted for a mellow\\ntenor than the bass you heard.\"\\n\\n\"Is he, then, much practised in the art of psalmody?\" demanded her\\nsimple companion.\\n\\nAlice felt disposed to laugh, though she succeeded in suppressing her\\nmerriment, ere she answered,--\\n\\n\"I apprehend that he is rather addicted to profane song. The chances of\\na soldier\\'s life are but little fitted for the encouragement of more\\nsober inclinations.\"\\n\\n\"Man\\'s voice is given to him, like his other talents, to be used, and\\nnot to be abused. None can say they have ever known me neglect my gifts!\\nI am thankful that, though my boyhood may be said to have been set\\napart, like the youth of the royal David, for the purposes of music, no\\nsyllable of rude verse has ever profaned my lips.\"\\n\\n\"You have, then, limited your efforts to sacred song?\"\\n\\n\"Even so. As the psalms of David exceed all other language, so does the\\npsalmody that has been fitted to them by the divines and sages of the\\nland, surpass all vain poetry. Happily, I may say that I utter nothing\\nbut the thoughts and the wishes of the King of Israel himself; for\\nthough the times may call for some slight changes, yet does this version\\nwhich we use in the colonies of New England, so much exceed all other\\nversions, that, by its richness, its exactness, and its spiritual\\nsimplicity, it approacheth, as near as may be, to the great work of the\\ninspired writer. I never abide in any place, sleeping or waking, without\\nan example of this gifted work. \\'Tis the six-and-twentieth edition,\\npromulgated at Boston, Anno Domini 1744; and is entitled, _The Psalms,\\nHymns, and Spiritual Songs of the Old and New Testaments; faithfully\\ntranslated into English Metre, for the Use, Edification, and Comfort of\\nthe Saints, in Public and Private, especially in New England_.\"\\n\\nDuring this eulogium on the rare production of his native poets, the\\nstranger had drawn the book from his pocket, and, fitting a pair of\\niron-rimmed spectacles to his nose, opened the volume with a care and\\nveneration suited to its sacred purposes. Then, without circumlocution\\nor apology, first pronouncing the word \"Standish,\" and placing the\\nunknown engine, already described, to his mouth, from which he drew a\\nhigh, shrill sound, that was followed by an octave below, from his own\\nvoice, he commenced singing the following words, in full, sweet, and\\nmelodious tones, that set the music, the poetry, and even the uneasy\\nmotion of his ill-trained beast at defiance:--\\n\\n  \"How good it is, O see,\\n    And how it pleaseth well,\\n  Together, e\\'en in unity,\\n    For brethren so to dwell.\\n  It\\'s like the choice ointment,\\n    From the head to the beard did go:\\n  Down Aaron\\'s beard, that downward went,\\n    His garment\\'s skirts unto.\"\\n\\nThe delivery of these skilful rhymes was accompanied, on the part of the\\nstranger, by a regular rise and fall of his right hand, which\\nterminated at the descent, by suffering the fingers to dwell a moment on\\nthe leaves of the little volume; and on the ascent, by such a flourish\\nof the member as none but the initiated may ever hope to imitate. It\\nwould seem that long practice had rendered this manual accompaniment\\nnecessary; for it did not cease until the preposition which the poet had\\nselected for the close of his verse, had been duly delivered like a word\\nof two syllables.\\n\\nSuch an innovation on the silence and retirement of the forest could not\\nfail to enlist the ears of those who journeyed at so short a distance in\\nadvance. The Indian muttered a few words in broken English to Heyward,\\nwho, in his turn, spoke to the stranger; at once interrupting, and, for\\nthe time, closing his musical efforts.\\n\\n\"Though we are not in danger, common prudence would teach us to journey\\nthrough this wilderness in as quiet a manner as possible. You will,\\nthen, pardon me, Alice, should I diminish your enjoyments, by requesting\\nthis gentleman to postpone his chant until a safer opportunity.\"\\n\\n\"You will diminish them, indeed,\" returned the arch girl, \"for never did\\nI hear a more unworthy conjunction of execution and language, than that\\nto which I have been listening; and I was far gone in a learned inquiry\\ninto the causes of such an unfitness between sound and sense, when you\\nbroke the charm of my musings by that bass of yours, Duncan!\"\\n\\n\"I know not what you call my bass,\" said Heyward, piqued at her remark,\\n\"but I know that your safety, and that of Cora, is far dearer to me than\\ncould be any orchestra of Handel\\'s music.\" He paused and turned his head\\nquickly towards a thicket, and then bent his eyes suspiciously on their\\nguide, who continued his steady pace, in undisturbed gravity. The young\\nman smiled to himself, for he believed he had mistaken some shining\\nberry of the woods for the glistening eyeballs of a prowling savage, and\\nhe rode forward, continuing the conversation which had been interrupted\\nby the passing thought.\\n\\nMajor Heyward was mistaken only in suffering his youthful and generous\\npride to suppress his active watchfulness. The cavalcade had not long\\npassed, before the branches of the bushes that formed the thicket were\\ncautiously moved asunder, and a human visage, as fiercely wild as savage\\nart and unbridled passions could make it, peered out on the retiring\\nfootsteps of the travellers. A gleam of exultation shot across the\\ndarkly painted lineaments of the inhabitant of the forest, as he traced\\nthe route of his intended victims, who rode unconsciously onward; the\\nlight and graceful forms of the females waving among the trees, in the\\ncurvatures of their path, followed at each bend by the manly figure of\\nHeyward, until, finally, the shapeless person of the singing-master was\\nconcealed behind the numberless trunks of trees, that rose, in dark\\nlines, in the intermediate space.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "   'summary_text': 'Before any characters appear, the time and geography are made clear. Though it is the last war that England and France waged for a country that neither would retain, the wilderness between the forces still has to be overcome first. Thus it is in 1757, in the New York area between the head waters of the Hudson River and Lake George to the north. Because only two years earlier General Braddock was disgracefully routed by a handful of French and Indians, the frontier is now exposed to real and imaginary savage disasters as well as to the horrors of warfare. Fear has replaced reason. Near dusk of a day in July, an Indian runner named Magua arrives at Fort Edward on the upper Hudson. He has come from Fort William Henry at the southern tip of Lake George with the news that the French General Montcalm is moving south with a very large army and that Munro, commander of Fort William Henry, is in urgent need of plentiful reinforcements from General Webb. Early the next morning, a limited detachment of fifteen hundred regulars and colonists departs as if swallowed by the forest. Shortly afterwards, Major Duncan Heyward and Alice and Cora Munro, guided by Magua on foot, take by horseback a secret route toward William Henry for the girls to join their father. Blonde Alice is doubtful about Magua, covered with war paint and showing a sullen fierceness; but dark-haired Cora is stoically common sense about him, even though Heyward mentions that their father had once had to deal rigidly with the Indian. As the small party pushes on, they are overtaken by David Gamut, a tall, ungainly psalmodist ridiculously dressed and carrying a pitch pipe while riding a mare followed by its young colt. He desires to join them, and after some banter between him and Alice, he pulls out the twenty-sixth edition of The Bay Psalm Book, sounds his pipe, and renders a song \"in full, sweet, and melodious tones.\" At a muttered comment from Magua, Heyward insists upon silence for safety. Then he glances about them and, satisfied that he has seen only shining berries, smiles to himself as they move on. But he is wrong. The branches move and a man peers exultingly after them as they disappear among the dark lines of trees.',\n",
       "   'summary_analysis': \"These two chapters introduce the reader to the historical and natural settings and are indicative of the extent to which this book, as a historical novel, relates its fictional characters to real history. Only here at the beginning and later at mid-novel will the action coincide in detail with actual events, though the historic war is always somewhere in the near distance. These chapters also present four of the main fictional characters and one secondary one, all of whom will merit our concern henceforth. Major Heyward is the gallant romantic hero, but unlike most sentimental romances where for each hero there is one heroine, here there are two, Alice and Cora, blonde and brunette. And it is immediately apparent that the old tradition of weak-blonde-strong-brunette contrast is at work, stereotyping the fair Alice and dark Cora. These three are rather predictable types which both simplify and stultify the writer's efforts with them. Magua's stealthy eyes and abrupt, furtive actions mark him as a potential villain, while the exaggerated presentation of the simple, single-minded Gamut paints him as the comic and perhaps pitiable adult innocent. At this point, both are something less than realistic and fully vitalized characters, but in comparison to the other three they seem to breathe real air. The stature of originality and verisimilitude that they do show is doubtless due to the fact that they are native characters. One may note, for instance, that Heyward's comment about Munro's once dealing rigidly with Magua not only lends suspense to the situation and points to the theme of revenge but also suggests some depth of motivation for the Indian. What we call plot -- the complications of a situation and the subsequent events and actions that further entangle things before they are finally resolved in some fashion -- starts an early ferment in terms of danger and suspense. Four likable and somewhat innocent characters strike into the unknown forest wilderness with a doubtful guide. It is a time of urgency, and movement is swift. Cooper hardly gives the reader time to question seriously why Munro's daughters would push forward their visit at this worst of times and would feel themselves safer almost alone on a dim path in savage-infested territory than in the company of fifteen hundred trained fighting men. This represents a lack in character motivation, but Cooper knows that he must get his people into jeopardy, and he at least partly succeeds in hiding this lack under suspenseful action and a sense of urgency. But in spite of the pace, Cooper also manages a good instance of dramatic irony, a fictional presentation in which the reader is allowed to see or deduce predicaments unknown or only partly known by the characters. It is thus that the first part of the pattern of action -- that of pursuit -- has begun.\",\n",

It is now afternoon. The Indian and the scout are attired according to their forest habits: Chingachgook with his semi-nude, war-painted body and scalping tuft of hair, his tomahawk, scalping knife, and short rifle; Hawkeye with his hunting shirt, skin cap, buckskin leggings, knife, pouch and horn, and long rifle. They discuss their respective forefathers, and Chingachgook relates the slow demise of his tribe of Mohicans so that only he and his son Uncas now remain. At the mention of his name, Uncas, a youthful warrior dressed much like Hawkeye, appears and says that he has been on the trail of the Maquas, another name for the Mengwe or Iroquois, their natural enemies. The antlers of a deer are seen in the distance, and Hawkeye is about to shoot the animal for food when the warrior warns him that a shot will warn the enemy. Just as Uncas kills it with an arrow, they hear the sounds of feet which Chingachgook recognizes as the horses of white men.\", \"analysis\": \"This chapter introduces the other three main actors in the story.

       "   'chapter': '\\n  \"Before these fields were shorn and tilled,\\n    Full to the brim our rivers flowed;\\n  The melody of waters filled\\n    The fresh and boundless wood;\\n  And torrents dashed, and rivulets played,\\n    And fountains spouted in the shade.\"\\n\\n  BRYANT.\\n\\n\\nLeaving the unsuspecting Heyward and his confiding companions to\\npenetrate still deeper into a forest that contained such treacherous\\ninmates, we must use an author\\'s privilege, and shift the scene a few\\nmiles to the westward of the place where we have last seen them.\\n\\nOn that day, two men were lingering on the banks of a small but rapid\\nstream, within an hour\\'s journey of the encampment of Webb, like those\\nwho awaited the appearance of an absent person, or the approach of some\\nexpected event. The vast canopy of woods spread itself to the margin of\\nthe river overhanging the water, and shadowing its dark current with a\\ndeeper hue. The rays of the sun were beginning to grow less fierce, and\\nthe intense heat of the day was lessened, as the cooler vapors of the\\nsprings and fountains rose above their leafy beds, and rested in the\\natmosphere. Still that breathing silence, which marks the drowsy\\nsultriness of an American landscape in July, pervaded the secluded spot,\\ninterrupted only by the low voices of the men, the occasional and lazy\\ntap of a woodpecker, the discordant cry of some gaudy jay, or a swelling\\non the ear, from the dull roar of a distant waterfall.\\n\\nThese feeble and broken sounds were, however, too familiar to the\\nforesters, to draw their attention from the more interesting matter of\\ntheir dialogue. While one of these loiterers showed the red skin and\\nwild accoutrements of a native of the woods, the other exhibited,\\nthrough the mask of his rude and nearly savage equipments, the brighter,\\nthough sunburnt and long-faded complexion of one who might claim descent\\nfrom a European parentage. The former was seated on the end of a mossy\\nlog, in a posture that permitted him to heighten the effect of his\\nearnest language, by the calm but expressive gestures of an Indian\\nengaged in debate. His body, which was nearly naked, presented a\\nterrific emblem of death, drawn in intermingled colors of white and\\nblack. His closely shaved head, on which no other hair than the well\\nknown and chivalrous scalping tuft[5] was preserved, was without\\nornament of any kind, with the exception of a solitary eagle\\'s plume,\\nthat crossed his crown, and depended over the left shoulder. A tomahawk\\nand scalping-knife, of English manufacture, were in his girdle; while a\\nshort military rifle, of that sort with which the policy of the whites\\narmed their savage allies, lay carelessly across his bare and sinewy\\nknee. The expanded chest, full formed limbs, and grave countenance of\\nthis warrior, would denote that he had reached the vigor of his days,\\nthough no symptoms of decay appeared to have yet weakened his manhood.\\n\\nThe frame of the white man, judging by such parts as were not concealed\\nby his clothes, was like that of one who had known hardships and\\nexertion from his earliest youth. His person, though muscular, was\\nrather attenuated than full; but every nerve and muscle appeared strung\\nand indurated by unremitted exposure and toil. He wore a hunting-shirt\\nof forest green, fringed with faded yellow[6], and a summer cap of skins\\nwhich had been shorn of their fur. He also bore a knife in a girdle of\\nwampum, like that which confined the scanty garments of the Indian, but\\nno tomahawk. His moccasins were ornamented after the gay fashion of the\\nnatives, while the only part of his under-dress which appeared below the\\nhunting-frock, was a pair of buckskin leggings, that laced at the sides,\\nand which were gartered above the knees with the sinews of a deer. A\\npouch and horn completed his personal accoutrements, though a rifle of\\ngreat length[7], which the theory of the more ingenious whites had\\ntaught them was the most dangerous of all fire-arms, leaned against a\\nneighboring sapling. The eye of the hunter, or scout, whichever he might\\nbe, was small, quick, keen, and restless, roving while he spoke, on\\nevery side of him, as if in quest of game, or distrusting the sudden\\napproach of some lurking enemy. Notwithstanding the symptoms of habitual\\nsuspicion, his countenance was not only without guile, but at the moment\\nat which he is introduced, it was charged with an expression of sturdy\\nhonesty.\\n\\n\"Even your traditions make the case in my favor, Chingachgook,\" he said,\\nspeaking in the tongue which was known to all the natives who formerly\\ninhabited the country between the Hudson and the Potomac, and of which\\nwe shall give a free translation for the benefit of the reader;\\nendeavoring, at the same time, to preserve some of the peculiarities,\\nboth of the individual and of the language. \"Your fathers came from the\\nsetting sun, crossed the big river,[8] fought the people of the country,\\nand took the land; and mine came from the red sky of the morning, over\\nthe salt lake, and did their work much after the fashion that had been\\nset them by yours; then let God judge the matter between us, and friends\\nspare their words!\"\\n\\n\"My fathers fought with the naked redmen!\" returned the Indian sternly,\\nin the same language. \"Is there no difference, Hawkeye, between the\\nstone-headed arrow of the warrior, and the leaden bullet with which you\\nkill?\"\\n\\n\"There is reason in an Indian, though nature has made him with a red\\nskin!\" said the white man, shaking his head like one on whom such an\\nappeal to his justice was not thrown away. For a moment he appeared to\\nbe conscious of having the worst of the argument, then, rallying again,\\nhe answered the objection of his antagonist in the best manner his\\nlimited information would allow: \"I am no scholar, and I care not who\\nknows it; but judging from what I have seen, at deer chases and squirrel\\nhunts, of the sparks below, I should think a rifle in the hands of their\\ngrandfathers was not so dangerous as a hickory bow and a good flint-head\\nmight be, if drawn with Indian judgment, and sent by an Indian eye.\"\\n\\n\"You have the story told by your fathers,\" returned the other, coldly\\nwaving his hand. \"What say your old men? do they tell the young\\nwarriors, that the pale-faces met the redmen, painted for war and armed\\nwith the stone hatchet and wooden gun?\"\\n\\n\"I am not a prejudiced man, nor one who vaunts himself on his natural\\nprivileges, though the worst enemy I have on earth, and he is an\\nIroquois, daren\\'t deny that I am genuine white,\" the scout replied,\\nsurveying, with secret satisfaction, the faded color of his bony and\\nsinewy hand; \"and I am willing to own that my people have many ways, of\\nwhich, as an honest man, I can\\'t approve. It is one of their customs to\\nwrite in books what they have done and seen, instead of telling them in\\ntheir villages, where the lie can be given to the face of a cowardly\\nboaster, and the brave soldier can call on his comrades to witness for\\nthe truth of his words. In consequence of this bad fashion, a man who is\\ntoo conscientious to misspend his days among the women, in learning the\\nnames of black marks, may never hear of the deeds of his fathers, nor\\nfeel a pride in striving to outdo them. For myself, I conclude the\\nBumppos could shoot, for I have a natural turn with a rifle, which must\\nhave been handed down from generation to generation, as, our holy\\ncommandments tell us, all good and evil gifts are bestowed; though I\\nshould be loth to answer for other people in such a matter. But every\\nstory has its two sides; so I ask you, Chingachgook, what passed,\\naccording to the traditions of the redmen, when our fathers first met?\"\\n\\nA silence of a minute succeeded, during which the Indian sat mute; then,\\nfull of the dignity of his office, he commenced his brief tale, with a\\nsolemnity that served to heighten its appearance of truth.\\n\\n\"Listen, Hawkeye, and your ear shall drink no lie. \\'Tis what my fathers\\nhave said, and what the Mohicans have done.\" He hesitated a single\\ninstant, and bending a cautious glance toward his companion, he\\ncontinued, in a manner that was divided between interrogation and\\nassertion, \"Does not this stream at our feet run towards the summer,\\nuntil its waters grow salt, and the current flows upward?\"\\n\\n\"It can\\'t be denied that your traditions tell you true in both these\\nmatters,\" said the white man; \"for I have been there, and have seen\\nthem; though, why water, which is so sweet in the shade, should become\\nbitter in the sun, is an alteration for which I have never been able to\\naccount.\"\\n\\n\"And the current!\" demanded the Indian, who expected his reply with that\\nsort of interest that a man feels in the confirmation of testimony, at\\nwhich he marvels even while he respects it; \"the fathers of Chingachgook\\nhave not lied!\"\\n\\n\"The Holy Bible is not more true, and that is the truest thing in\\nnature. They call this up-stream current the tide, which is a thing soon\\nexplained, and clear enough. Six hours the waters run in, and six hours\\nthey run out, and the reason is this: when there is higher water in the\\nsea than in the river, they run in, until the river gets to be highest,\\nand then it runs out again.\"\\n\\n\"The waters in the woods, and on the great lakes, run downward until\\nthey lie like my hand,\" said the Indian, stretching the limb\\nhorizontally before him, \"and then they run no more.\"\\n\\n\"No honest man will deny it,\" said the scout, a little nettled at the\\nimplied distrust of his explanation of the mystery of the tides; \"and I\\ngrant that it is true on the small scale, and where the land is level.\\nBut everything depends on what scale you look at things. Now, on the\\nsmall scale, the \\'arth is level; but on the large scale it is round. In\\nthis manner, pools and ponds, and even the great fresh-water lake, may\\nbe stagnant, as you and I both know they are, having seen them; but when\\nyou come to spread water over a great tract, like the sea, where the\\nearth is round, how in reason can the water be quiet? You might as well\\nexpect the river to lie still on the brink of those black rocks a mile\\nabove us, though your own ears tell you that it is tumbling over them at\\nthis very moment!\"\\n\\nIf unsatisfied by the philosophy of his companion, the Indian was far\\ntoo dignified to betray his unbelief. He listened like one who was\\nconvinced, and resumed his narrative in his former solemn manner.\\n\\n\"We came from the place where the sun is hid at night, over great plains\\nwhere the buffaloes live, until we reached the big river. There we\\nfought the Alligewi, till the ground was red with their blood. From the\\nbanks of the big river to the shores of the salt lake, there was none to\\nmeet us. The Maquas followed at a distance. We said the country should\\nbe ours from the place where the water runs up no longer on this stream,\\nto a river twenty suns\\' journey toward the summer. The land we had taken\\nlike warriors, we kept like men. We drove the Maquas into the woods with\\nthe bears. They only tasted salt at the licks; they drew no fish from\\nthe great lake; we threw them the bones.\"\\n\\n\"All this I have heard and believe,\" said the white man, observing that\\nthe Indian paused: \"but it was long before the English came into the\\ncountry.\"\\n\\n\"A pine grew then where this chestnut now stands. The first pale-faces\\nwho came among us spoke no English. They came in a large canoe, when my\\nfathers had buried the tomahawk with the redmen around them. Then,\\nHawkeye,\" he continued, betraying his deep emotion only by permitting\\nhis voice to fall to those low, guttural tones, which rendered his\\nlanguage, as spoken at times, so very musical; \"then, Hawkeye, we were\\none people, and we were happy. The salt lake gave us its fish, the wood\\nits deer, and the air its birds. We took wives who bore us children; we\\nworshipped the Great Spirit; and we kept the Maquas beyond the sound of\\nour songs of triumph!\"\\n\\n\"Know you anything of your own family at that time?\" demanded the white.\\n\"But you are a just man, for an Indian! and, as I suppose you hold their\\ngifts, your fathers must have been brave warriors, and wise men at the\\ncouncil fire.\"\\n\\n\"My tribe is the grandfather of nations, but I am an unmixed man. The\\nblood of chiefs is in my veins, where it must stay forever. The Dutch\\nlanded, and gave my people the fire-water; they drank until the heavens\\nand the earth seemed to meet, and they foolishly thought they had found\\nthe Great Spirit. Then they parted with their land. Foot by foot, they\\nwere driven back from the shores, until I, that am a chief and a\\nsagamore, have never seen the sun shine but through the trees, and have\\nnever visited the graves of, my fathers!\"\\n\\n\"Graves bring solemn feelings over the mind,\" returned the scout, a good\\ndeal touched at the calm suffering of his companion; \"and they often aid\\na man in his good intentions; though, for myself, I expect to leave my\\nown bones unburied, to bleach in the woods, or to be torn asunder by the\\nwolves. But where are to be found those of your race who came to their\\nkin in the Delaware country, so many summers since?\"\\n\\n\"Where are the blossoms of those summers!--fallen, one by one: so all of\\nmy family departed, each in his turn, to the land of spirits. I am on\\nthe hill-top, and must go down into the valley; and when Uncas follows\\nin my footsteps, there will no longer be any of the blood of the\\nsagamores, for my boy is the last of the Mohicans.\"\\n\\n\"Uncas is here!\" said another voice, in the same soft, guttural tones,\\nnear his elbow; \"who speaks to Uncas?\"\\n\\nThe white man loosened his knife in his leathern sheath, and made an\\ninvoluntary movement of the hand towards his rifle, at this sudden\\ninterruption; but the Indian sat composed, and without turning his head\\nat the unexpected sounds.\\n\\nAt the next instant, a youthful warrior passed between them, with a\\nnoiseless step, and seated himself on the bank of the rapid stream. No\\nexclamation of surprise escaped the father, nor was any question asked,\\nor reply given, for several minutes; each appearing to await the moment\\nwhen he might speak, without betraying womanish curiosity or childish\\nimpatience. The white man seemed to take counsel from their customs,\\nand, relinquishing his grasp of the rifle, he also remained silent and\\nreserved. At length Chingachgook turned his eyes slowly towards his son,\\nand demanded,--\\n\\n\"Do the Maquas dare to leave the print of their moccasins in these\\nwoods?\"\\n\\n\"I have been on their trail,\" replied the young Indian, \"and know that\\nthey number as many as the fingers of my two hands; but they lie hid,\\nlike cowards.\"\\n\\n\"The thieves are outlying for scalps and plunder!\" said the white man,\\nwhom we shall call Hawkeye, after the manner of his companions. \"That\\nbushy Frenchman, Montcalm, will send his spies into our very camp, but\\nhe will know what road we travel!\"\\n\\n\"Tis enough!\" returned the father, glancing his eye towards the setting\\nsun; \"they shall be driven like deer from their bushes. Hawkeye, let us\\neat to-night, and show the Maquas that we are men to-morrow.\"\\n\\n\"I am as ready to do the one as the other; but to fight the Iroquois\\n\\'tis necessary to find the skulkers; and to eat, \\'tis necessary to get\\nthe game--talk of the devil and he will come; there is a pair of the\\nbiggest antlers I have seen this season, moving the bushes below the\\nhill! Now, Uncas,\" he continued in a half whisper, and laughing with a\\nkind of inward sound, like one who had learnt to be watchful, \"I will\\nbet my charger three times full of powder, against a foot of wampum,\\nthat I take him atwixt the eyes, and nearer to the right than to the\\nleft.\"\\n\\n\"It cannot be!\" said the young Indian, springing to his feet with\\nyouthful eagerness; \"all but the tips of his horns are hid!\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s a boy!\" said the white man, shaking his head while he spoke, and\\naddressing the father. \"Does he think when a hunter sees a part of the\\ncreatur\\', he can\\'t tell where the rest of him should be!\"\\n\\n[Illustration: _Copyright by Charles Scribner\\'s Sons_\\n\\nUNCAS SLAYS A DEER\\n\\n_Avoiding the horns of the infuriated animal, Uncas darted to his side,\\nand passed his knife across the throat_]\\n\\nAdjusting his rifle, he was about to make an exhibition of that skill,\\non which he so much valued himself, when the warrior struck up the piece\\nwith his hand, saying--\\n\\n\"Hawkeye! will you fight the Maquas?\"\\n\\n\"These Indians know the nature of the woods, as it might be by\\ninstinct!\" returned the scout, dropping his rifle, and turning away like\\na man who was convinced of his error. \"I must leave the buck to your\\narrow, Uncas, or we may kill a deer for them thieves, the Iroquois, to\\neat.\"\\n\\nThe instant the father seconded this intimation by an expressive gesture\\nof the hand, Uncas threw himself on the ground, and approached the\\nanimal with wary movements. When within a few yards of the cover, he\\nfitted an arrow to his bow with the utmost care, while the antlers\\nmoved, as if their owner snuffed an enemy in the tainted air. In another\\nmoment the twang of the cord was heard, a white streak was seen glancing\\ninto the bushes, and the wounded buck plunged from the cover, to the\\nvery feet of his hidden enemy. Avoiding the horns of the infuriated\\nanimal, Uncas darted to his side, and passed his knife across the\\nthroat, when bounding to the edge of the river it fell, dyeing the\\nwaters with its blood.\\n\\n\"\\'Twas done with Indian skill,\" said the scout, laughing inwardly, but\\nwith vast satisfaction; \"and \\'twas a pretty sight to behold!

What do you hear, Chingachgook? for to\\nmy ears the woods are dumb.\"\\n\\n\"There is but one deer, and he is dead,\" said the Indian, bending his\\nbody till his ear nearly touched the earth. \"I hear the sounds of feet!\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps the wolves have driven the buck to shelter, and are following\\non his trail.\"\\n\\n\"No. The horses of white men are coming!\" returned the other, raising\\nhimself with dignity, and resuming his seat on the log with his former\\ncomposure. \"Hawkeye, they are your brothers; speak to them.\"\\n\\n\"That will I, and in English that the king needn\\'t be ashamed to\\nanswer,\" returned the hunter, speaking in the language of which he\\nboasted; \"but I see nothing, nor do I hear the sounds of man or beast;\\n\\'tis strange that an Indian should understand white sounds better than a\\nman who, his very enemies will own, has no cross in his blood, although\\nhe may have lived with the redskins long enough to be suspected! Ha!\\nthere goes something like the cracking of a dry stick, too--now I hear\\nthe bushes move--yes, yes, there is a trampling that I mistook for the\\nfalls--and--but here they come themselves; God keep them from the\\nIroquois!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "   'summary_text': 'In another part of the forest by the river a few miles to the west, Hawkeye and Chingachgook appear to be waiting for someone as they talk with low voices. It is now afternoon. The Indian and the scout are attired according to their forest habits: Chingachgook with his semi-nude, war-painted body and scalping tuft of hair, his tomahawk, scalping knife, and short rifle; Hawkeye with his hunting shirt, skin cap, buckskin leggings, knife, pouch and horn, and long rifle. They discuss their respective forefathers, and Chingachgook relates the slow demise of his tribe of Mohicans so that only he and his son Uncas now remain. At the mention of his name, Uncas, a youthful warrior dressed much like Hawkeye, appears and says that he has been on the trail of the Maquas, another name for the Mengwe or Iroquois, their natural enemies. The antlers of a deer are seen in the distance, and Hawkeye is about to shoot the animal for food when the warrior warns him that a shot will warn the enemy. Just as Uncas kills it with an arrow, they hear the sounds of feet which Chingachgook recognizes as the horses of white men.',\n",

Through the talk of the scout and the senior Indian, the rightness of racial \"gifts\" is established. Their discussion of differences between currents and tides, between the large salt ocean and the smaller fresh lakes, reflects the novel\\'s central motif of relativity as Hawkeye concludes that \"\\'everything depends on what scale you look at things.\" Hawkeye\\'s precipitant movement to shoot the deer at first makes his awareness of the forest dangers questionable, but the need for action is natural to this kind of man after idleness, and the incident shows his pride in handling his rifle. Such an incident makes this ideal frontiersman also human. By the end of this chapter, all the principal characters are introduced, with each one\\'s general qualities established. They are about to be brought together to participate in the first long chase sequence.',\n",

       "   'chapter': '\\n  \"Well, go thy way: thou shalt not from this grove\\n  Till I torment thee for this injury.\"\\n\\n  _Midsummer Night\\'s Dream._\\n\\n\\nThe words were still in the mouth of the scout, when the leader of the\\nparty, whose approaching footsteps had caught the vigilant ear of the\\nIndian, came openly into view. A beaten path, such as those made by the\\nperiodical passage of the deer, wound through a little glen at no great\\ndistance, and struck the river at the point where the white man and his\\nred companions had posted themselves. Along this track the travellers,\\nwho had produced a surprise so unusual in the depths of the forest,\\nadvanced slowly towards the hunter, who was in front of his associates,\\nin readiness to receive them.\\n\\n\"Who comes?\" demanded the scout, throwing his rifle carelessly across\\nhis left arm, and keeping the forefinger of his right hand on the\\ntrigger, though he avoided all appearance of menace in the act, \"Who\\ncomes hither, among the beasts and dangers of the wilderness?\"\\n\\n\"Believers in religion, and friends to the law and to the king,\"\\nreturned he who rode foremost. \"Men who have journeyed since the rising\\nsun, in the shades of this forest, without nourishment, and are sadly\\ntired of their wayfaring.\"\\n\\n\"You are, then, lost,\" interrupted the hunter, \"and have found how\\nhelpless \\'tis not to know whether to take the right hand or the left?\"\\n\\n\"Even so; sucking babes are not more dependent on those who guide them\\nthan we who are of larger growth, and who may now be said to possess the\\nstature without the knowledge of men. Know you the distance to a post of\\nthe crown called William Henry?\"\\n\\n\"Hoot!\" shouted the scout, who did not spare his open laughter, though,\\ninstantly checking the dangerous sounds, he indulged his merriment at\\nless risk of being overheard by any lurking enemies. \"You are as much\\noff the scent as a hound would be, with Horican atwixt him and the deer!\\nWilliam Henry, man! if you are friends to the king, and have business\\nwith the army, your better way would be to follow the river down to\\nEdward, and lay the matter before Webb; who tarries there, instead of\\npushing into the defiles, and driving this saucy Frenchman back across\\nChamplain, into his den again.\"\\n\\nBefore the stranger could make any reply to this unexpected proposition,\\nanother horseman dashed the bushes aside, and leaped his charger into\\nthe pathway, in front of his companion.\\n\\n\"What, then, may be our distance from Fort Edward?\" demanded a new\\nspeaker; \"the place you advise us to seek we left this morning, and our\\ndestination is the head of the lake.\"\\n\\n\"Then you must have lost your eyesight afore losing your way, for the\\nroad across the portage is cut to a good two rods, and is as grand a\\npath, I calculate, as any that runs into London, or even before the\\npalace of the king himself.\"\\n\\n\"We will not dispute concerning the excellence of the passage,\" returned\\nHeyward, smiling; for, as the reader has anticipated, it was he. \"It is\\nenough, for the present, that we trusted to an Indian guide to take us\\nby a nearer, though blinder path, and that we are deceived in his\\nknowledge. In plain words, we know not where we are.\"\\n\\n\"An Indian lost in the woods!\" said the scout, shaking his head\\ndoubtingly; \"when the sun is scorching the tree-tops, and the\\nwater-courses are full; when the moss on every beech he sees, will tell\\nhim in which quarter the north star will shine at night! The woods are\\nfull of deer paths which run to the streams and licks, places well known\\nto everybody; nor have the geese done their flight to the Canada waters\\naltogether! \\'Tis strange that an Indian should be lost atwixt Horican\\nand the bend in the river. Is he a Mohawk?\"\\n\\n\"Not by birth, though adopted in that tribe; I think his birthplace was\\nfarther north, and he is one of those you call a Huron.\"\\n\\n\"Hugh!\" exclaimed the two companions of the scout, who had continued,\\nuntil this part of the dialogue, seated immovable, and apparently\\nindifferent to what passed, but who now sprang to their feet with an\\nactivity and interest that had evidently got the better of their\\nreserve, by surprise.\\n\\n\"A Huron!\" repeated the sturdy scout, once more shaking his head in open\\ndistrust; \"they are a thievish race, nor do I care by whom they are\\nadopted; you can never make anything of them but skulks and vagabonds.\\nSince you trusted yourself to the care of one of that nation, I only\\nwonder that you have not fallen in with more.\"\\n\\n\"Of that there is little danger, since William Henry is so many miles in\\nour front. You forget that I have told you our guide is now a Mohawk,\\nand that he serves with our forces as a friend.\"\\n\\n\"And I tell you that he who is born a Mingo will die a Mingo,\" returned\\nthe other, positively. \"A Mohawk! No, give me a Delaware or a Mohican\\nfor honesty; and when they will fight, which they won\\'t all do, having\\nsuffered their cunning enemies, the Maquas, to make them women--but when\\nthey will fight at all, look to a Delaware, or a Mohican, for a\\nwarrior!\"\\n\\n\"Enough of this,\" said Heyward, impatiently; \"I wish not to inquire into\\nthe character of a man that I know, and to whom you must be a stranger.\\nYou have not yet answered my question: what is our distance from the\\nmain army at Edward?\"\\n\\n\"It seems that may depend on who is your guide. One would think such a\\nhorse as that might get over a good deal of ground atwixt sun-up and\\nsun-down.\"\\n\\n\"I wish no contention of idle words with you, friend,\" said Heyward,\\ncurbing his dissatisfied manner, and speaking in a more gentle voice;\\n\"if you will tell me the distance to Fort Edward, and conduct me\\nthither, your labor shall not go without its reward.\"\\n\\n\"And in so doing, how know I that I don\\'t guide an enemy, and a spy of\\nMontcalm, to the works of the army? It is not every man who can speak\\nthe English tongue that is an honest subject.\"\\n\\n\"If you serve with the troops, of whom I judge you to be a scout, you\\nshould know of such a regiment of the king as the 60th.\"\\n\\n\"The 60th! you can tell me little of the Royal Americans that I don\\'t\\nknow, though I do wear a hunting-shirt instead of a scarlet jacket.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, among the other things, you may know the name of its\\nmajor?\"\\n\\n\"Its major!\" interrupted the hunter, elevating his body like one who was\\nproud of his trust. \"If there is a man in the country who knows Major\\nEffingham, he stands before you.\"\\n\\n\"It is a corps which has many majors; the gentleman you name is the\\nsenior, but I speak of the junior of them all; he who commands the\\ncompanies in garrison at William Henry.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, I have heard that a young gentleman of vast riches, from one\\nof the provinces far south, has got the place. He is over young, too, to\\nhold such rank, and to be put above men whose heads are beginning to\\nbleach; and yet they say he is a soldier in his knowledge, and a gallant\\ngentleman!\"\\n\\n\"Whatever he may be, or however he may be qualified for his rank, he now\\nspeaks to you, and of course can be no enemy to dread.\"\\n\\nThe scout regarded Heyward in surprise, and then lifting his cap, he\\nanswered, in a tone less confident than before, though still expressing\\ndoubt,--\\n\\n\"I have heard a party was to leave the encampment this morning, for the\\nlake shore.\"\\n\\n\"You have heard the truth; but I preferred a nearer route, trusting to\\nthe knowledge of the Indian I mentioned.\"\\n\\n\"And he deceived you, and then deserted?\"\\n\\n\"Neither, as I believe; certainly not the latter, for he is to be found\\nin the rear.\"\\n\\n\"I should like to look at the creatur\\'; if it is a true Iroquois I can\\ntell him by his knavish look, and by his paint,\" said the scout,\\nstepping past the charger of Heyward, and entering the path behind the\\nmare of the singing-master, whose foal had taken advantage of the halt\\nto exact the maternal contribution. After shoving aside the bushes, and\\nproceeding a few paces, he encountered the females, who awaited the\\nresult of the conference with anxiety, and not entirely without\\napprehension. Behind these, the runner leaned against a tree, where he\\nstood the close examination of the scout with an air unmoved, though\\nwith a look so dark and savage, that it might in itself excite fear.\\nSatisfied with his scrutiny, the hunter soon left him. As he repassed\\nthe females, he paused a moment to gaze upon their beauty, answering to\\nthe smile and nod of Alice with a look of open pleasure. Thence he went\\nto the side of the motherly animal, and spending a minute in a fruitless\\ninquiry into the character of her rider, he shook his head and returned\\nto Heyward.\\n\\n\"A Mingo is a Mingo, and God having made him so, neither the Mohawks nor\\nany other tribe can alter him,\" he said, when he had regained his former\\nposition. \"If we were alone, and you would leave that noble horse at the\\nmercy of the wolves to-night, I could show you the way to Edward,\\nmyself, within an hour, for it lies only about an hour\\'s journey hence;\\nbut with such ladies in your company \\'tis impossible!\"\\n\\n\"And why? they are fatigued, but they are quite equal to a ride of a few\\nmore miles.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis a natural impossibility!\" repeated the scout; \"I wouldn\\'t walk a\\nmile in these woods after night gets into them, in company with that\\nrunner, for the best rifle in the colonies. They are full of outlying\\nIroquois, and your mongrel Mohawk knows where to find them too well, to\\nbe my companion.\"\\n\\n\"Think you so?\" said Heyward, leaning forward in the saddle, and\\ndropping his voice nearly to a whisper; \"I confess I have not been\\nwithout my own suspicions, though I have endeavored to conceal them, and\\naffected a confidence I have not always felt, on account of my\\ncompanions. It was because I suspected him that I would follow no\\nlonger; making him, as you see, follow me.\"\\n\\n\"I knew he was one of the cheats as soon as I laid eyes on him!\"\\nreturned the scout, placing a finger on his nose, in sign of caution.\\n\"The thief is leaning against the foot of the sugar sapling, that you\\ncan see over them bushes; his right leg is in a line with the bark of\\nthe tree, and,\" tapping his rifle, \"I can take him from where I stand,\\nbetween the ankle and the knee, with a single shot, putting an end to\\nhis tramping through the woods, for at least a month to come. If I\\nshould go back to him, the cunning varmint would suspect something, and\\nbe dodging through the trees like a frightened deer.\"\\n\\n\"It will not do. He may be innocent, and I dislike the act. Though, if I\\nfelt confident of his treachery--\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis a safe thing to calculate on the knavery of an Iroquois,\" said the\\nscout, throwing his rifle forward, by a sort of instinctive movement.\\n\\n\"Hold!\" interrupted Heyward, \"it will not do--we must think of some\\nother scheme; and yet, I have much reason to believe the rascal has\\ndeceived me.\"\\n\\nThe hunter, who had already abandoned his intention of maiming the\\nrunner, mused a moment, and then made a gesture, which instantly brought\\nhis two red companions to his side. They spoke together earnestly in the\\nDelaware language, though in an undertone; and by the gestures of the\\nwhite man, which were frequently directed towards the top of the\\nsapling, it was evident he pointed out the situation of their hidden\\nenemy. His companions were not long in comprehending his wishes, and\\nlaying aside their fire-arms, they parted, taking opposite sides of the\\npath, and burying themselves in the thicket, with such cautious\\nmovements, that their steps were inaudible.\\n\\n\"Now, go you back,\" said the hunter, speaking again to Heyward, \"and\\nhold the imp in talk; these Mohicans here will take him without breaking\\nhis paint.\"\\n\\n\"Nay,\" said Heyward, proudly, \"I will seize him myself.\"\\n\\n\"Hist! what could you do, mounted, against an Indian in the bushes?\"\\n\\n\"I will dismount.\"\\n\\n\"And, think you, when he saw one of your feet out of the stirrup, he\\nwould wait for the other to be free? Whoever comes into the woods to\\ndeal with the natives, must use Indian fashions, if he would wish to\\nprosper in his undertakings. Go, then, talk openly to the miscreant, and\\nseem to believe him the truest friend you have on \\'arth.\"\\n\\nHeyward prepared to comply, though with strong disgust at the nature of\\nthe office he was compelled to execute. Each moment, however, pressed\\nupon him a conviction of the critical situation in which he had suffered\\nhis invaluable trust to be involved through his own confidence. The sun\\nhad already disappeared, and the woods, suddenly deprived of his\\nlight,[9] were assuming a dusky hue, which keenly reminded him that the\\nhour the savage usually chose for his most barbarous and remorseless\\nacts of vengeance or hostility, was speedily drawing near. Stimulated by\\napprehension, he left the scout, who immediately entered into a loud\\nconversation with the stranger that had so unceremoniously enlisted\\nhimself in the party of travellers that morning. In passing his gentler\\ncompanions Heyward uttered a few words of encouragement, and was pleased\\nto find that, though fatigued with the exercise of the day, they\\nappeared to entertain no suspicion that their present embarrassment was\\nother than the result of accident. Giving them reason to believe he was\\nmerely employed in a consultation concerning the future route, he\\nspurred his charger, and drew the reins again, when the animal had\\ncarried him within a few yards of the place where the sullen runner\\nstill stood, leaning against the tree.\\n\\n\"You may see, Magua,\" he said, endeavoring to assume an air of freedom\\nand confidence, \"that the night is closing around us, and yet we are no\\nnearer to William Henry than when we left the encampment of Webb with\\nthe rising sun. You have missed the way, nor have I been more fortunate.\\nBut, happily we have fallen in with a hunter, he whom you hear talking\\nto the singer, that is acquainted with the deer-paths and by-ways of the\\nwoods, and who promises to lead us to a place where we may rest securely\\ntill the morning.\"\\n\\nThe Indian riveted his glowing eyes on Heyward as he asked, in his\\nimperfect English, \"Is he alone?\"\\n\\n\"Alone!\" hesitatingly answered Heyward to whom deception was too new to\\nbe assumed without embarrassment. \"O! not alone, surely, Magua, for you\\nknow that we are with him.\"\\n\\n\"Then Le Renard Subtil will go,\" returned the runner, coolly raising his\\nlittle wallet from the place where it had lain at his feet; \"and the\\npale-faces will see none but their own color.\"\\n\\n\"Go! Whom call you Le Renard?\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis the name his Canada fathers have given to Magua,\" returned the\\nrunner, with an air that manifested his pride at the distinction. \"Night\\nis the same as day to Le Subtil, when Munro waits for him.\"\\n\\n\"And what account will Le Renard give the chief of William Henry\\nconcerning his daughters? Will he dare to tell the hot-blooded Scotsman\\nthat his children are left without a guide, though Magua promised to be\\none?\"\\n\\n\"Though the gray head has a loud voice, and a long arm, Le Renard will\\nnot hear him, or feel him, in the woods.\"\\n\\n\"But what will the Mohawks say? They will make him petticoats, and bid\\nhim stay in the wigwam with the women, for he is no longer to be trusted\\nwith the business of a man.\"\\n\\n\"Le Subtil knows the path to the great lakes, and he can find the bones\\nof his fathers,\" was the answer of the unmoved runner.\\n\\n\"Enough, Magua,\" said Heyward; \"are we not friends? Why should there be\\nbitter words between us? Munro has promised you a gift for your services\\nwhen performed, and I shall be your debtor for another. Rest your weary\\nlimbs, then, and open your wallet to eat. We have a few moments to\\nspare; let us not waste them in talk like wrangling women. When the\\nladies are refreshed we will proceed.\"\\n\\n\"The pale-faces make themselves dogs to their women,\" muttered the\\nIndian, in his native language, \"and when they want to eat, their\\nwarriors must lay aside the tomahawk to feed their laziness.\"\\n\\n\"What say you, Renard?\"\\n\\n\"Le Subtil says it is good.\"\\n\\nThe Indian then fastened his eyes keenly on the open countenance of\\nHeyward, but meeting his glance, he turned them quickly away, and\\nseating himself deliberately on the ground, he drew forth the remnant of\\nsome former repast, and began to eat, though not without first bending\\nhis looks slowly and cautiously around him.\\n\\n\"This is well,\" continued Heyward; \"and Le Renard will have strength and\\nsight to find the path in the morning;\" he paused, for sounds like the\\nsnapping of a dried stick, and the rustling of leaves, rose from the\\nadjacent bushes, but recollecting himself instantly, he continued,--\"we\\nmust be moving before the sun is seen, or Montcalm may lie in our path,\\nand shut us out from the fortress.\"\\n\\nThe hand of Magua dropped from his mouth to his side, and though his\\neyes were fastened on the ground, his head was turned aside, his\\nnostrils expanded, and his ears seemed even to stand more erect than\\nusual, giving to him the appearance of a statue that was made to\\nrepresent intense attention.\\n\\nHeyward, who watched his movements with a vigilant eye, carelessly\\nextricated one of his feet from the stirrup, while he passed a hand\\ntowards the bear-skin covering of his holsters. Every effort to detect\\nthe point most regarded by the runner was completely frustrated by the\\ntremulous glances of his organs, which seemed not to rest a single\\ninstant on any particular object, and which, at the same time, could be\\nhardly said to move. While he hesitated how to proceed, Le Subtil\\ncautiously raised himself to his feet, though with a motion so slow and\\nguarded, that not the slightest noise was produced by the change.\\nHeyward felt it had now become incumbent on him to act. Throwing his leg\\nover the saddle, he dismounted, with a determination to advance and\\nseize his treacherous companion, trusting the result to his own manhood.\\nIn order, however, to prevent unnecessary alarm, he still preserved an\\nair of calmness and friendship.\\n\\n\"Le Renard Subtil does not eat,\" he said, using the appellation he had\\nfound most flattering to the vanity of the Indian. \"His corn is not well\\nparched, and it seems dry. Let me examine; perhaps something may be\\nfound among my own provisions that will help his appetite.\"\\n\\nMagua held out the wallet to the proffer of the other. He even suffered\\ntheir hands to meet, without betraying the least emotion, or varying his\\nriveted attitude of attention. But when he felt the fingers of Heyward\\nmoving gently along his own naked arm, he struck up the limb of the\\nyoung man, and uttering a piercing cry as he darted beneath it, plunged,\\nat a single bound, into the opposite thicket. At the next instant the\\nform of Chingachgook appeared from the bushes, looking like a spectre in\\nits paint, and glided across the path in swift pursuit. Next followed\\nthe shout of Uncas, when the woods were lighted by a sudden flash, that\\nwas accompanied by the sharp report of the hunter\\'s rifle.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "   'chapter': '\\n                      \"In such a night\\n  Did Thisbe fearfully o\\'ertrip the dew;\\n  And saw the lion\\'s shadow ere himself.\"\\n\\n  _Merchant of Venice._\\n\\n\\nThe suddenness of the flight of his guide, and the wild cries of the\\npursuers, caused Heyward to remain fixed, for a few moments, in inactive\\nsurprise. Then recollecting the importance of securing the fugitive, he\\ndashed aside the surrounding bushes, and pressed eagerly forward to lend\\nhis aid in the chase. Before he had, however, proceeded a hundred yards,\\nhe met the three foresters already returning from their unsuccessful\\npursuit.\\n\\n\"Why so soon disheartened!\" he exclaimed; \"the scoundrel must be\\nconcealed behind some of these trees, and may yet be secured. We are not\\nsafe while he goes at large.\"\\n\\n\"Would you set a cloud to chase the wind?\" returned the disappointed\\nscout; \"I heard the imp, brushing over the dry leaves, like a black\\nsnake, and blinking a glimpse of him, just over ag\\'in yon big pine, I\\npulled as it might be on the scent; but \\'twouldn\\'t do! and yet for a\\nreasoning aim, if anybody but myself had touched the trigger, I should\\ncall it a quick sight; and I may be accounted to have experience in\\nthese matters, and one who ought to know. Look at this sumach; its\\nleaves are red, though everybody knows the fruit is in the yellow\\nblossom, in the month of July!\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis the blood of Le Subtil! he is hurt, and may yet fall!\"\\n\\n\"No, no,\" returned the scout, in decided disapprobation of this opinion,\\n\"I rubbed the bark off a limb, perhaps, but the creature leaped the\\nlonger for it. A rifle-bullet acts on a running animal, when it barks\\nhim, much the same as one of your spurs on a horse; that is, it quickens\\nmotion, and puts life into the flesh, instead of taking it away. But\\nwhen it cuts the ragged hole, after a bound or two, there is, commonly,\\na stagnation of further leaping, be it Indian or be it deer!\"\\n\\n\"We are four able bodies, to one wounded man!\"\\n\\n\"Is life grievous to you?\" interrupted the scout. \"Yonder red devils\\nwould draw you within swing of the tomahawks of his comrades, before you\\nwere heated in the chase. It was an unthoughtful act in a man who has so\\noften slept with the war-whoop ringing in the air, to let off his piece\\nwithin sound of an ambushment! But then it was a natural temptation!\\n\\'twas very natural! Come, friends, let us move our station, and in such\\na fashion, too, as will throw the cunning of a Mingo on a wrong scent,\\nor our scalps will be drying in the wind in front of Montcalm\\'s marquee,\\nag\\'in this hour to-morrow.\"\\n\\nThis appalling declaration, which the scout uttered with the cool\\nassurance of a man who fully comprehended, while he did not fear to face\\nthe danger, served to remind Heyward of the importance of the charge\\nwith which he himself had been intrusted. Glancing his eyes around, with\\na vain effort to pierce the gloom that was thickening beneath the leafy\\narches of the forest, he felt as if, cut off from human aid, his\\nunresisting companions would soon lie at the entire mercy of those\\nbarbarous enemies, who, like beasts of prey, only waited till the\\ngathering darkness might render their blows more fatally certain. His\\nawakened imagination, deluded by the deceptive light, converted each\\nwaving bush, or the fragment of some fallen tree, into human forms, and\\ntwenty times he fancied he could distinguish the horrid visages of his\\nlurking foes, peering from their hiding-places, in never-ceasing\\nwatchfulness of the movements of his party. Looking upward, he found\\nthat the thin fleecy clouds, which evening had painted on the blue sky,\\nwere already losing their faintest tints of rose-color, while the\\nimbedded stream, which glided past the spot where he stood, was to be\\ntraced only by the dark boundary of its wooded banks.\\n\\n\"What is to be done?\" he said, feeling the utter helplessness of doubt\\nin such a pressing strait; \"desert me not, for God\\'s sake! remain to\\ndefend those I escort, and freely name your own reward!\"\\n\\nHis companions, who conversed apart in the language of their tribe,\\nheeded not this sudden and earnest appeal. Though their dialogue was\\nmaintained in low and cautious sounds, but little above a whisper,\\nHeyward, who now approached, could easily distinguish the earnest tones\\nof the younger warrior from the more deliberate speeches of his seniors.\\nIt was evident that they debated on the propriety of some measure that\\nnearly concerned the welfare of the travellers. Yielding to his\\npowerful interest in the subject, and impatient of a delay that seemed\\nfraught with so much additional danger, Heyward drew still nigher to the\\ndusky group, with an intention of making his offers of compensation more\\ndefinite, when the white man, motioning, with his hand, as if he\\nconceded the disputed point, turned away, saying in a sort of soliloquy,\\nand in the English tongue,--\\n\\n\"Uncas is right! it would not be the act of men to leave such harmless\\nthings to their fate, even though it breaks up the harboring place\\nforever. If you would save these tender blossoms from the fangs of the\\nworst of serpents, gentleman, you have neither time to lose nor\\nresolution to throw away!\"\\n\\n\"How can such a wish be doubted! have I not already offered--\"\\n\\n\"Offer your prayers to Him who can give us wisdom to circumvent the\\ncunning of the devils who fill these woods,\" calmly interrupted the\\nscout, \"but spare your offers of money, which neither you may live to\\nrealize, nor I to profit by. These Mohicans and I will do what man\\'s\\nthoughts can invent, to keep such flowers, which, though so sweet, were\\nnever made for the wilderness, from harm, and that without hope of any\\nother recompense but such as God always gives to upright dealings.\\nFirst, you must promise two things, both in your own name and for your\\nfriends, or without serving you, we shall only injure ourselves!\"\\n\\n\"Name them.\"\\n\\n\"The one is, to be still as these sleeping woods, let what will happen;\\nand the other is, to keep the place where we shall take you, forever a\\nsecret from all mortal men.\"\\n\\n\"I will do my utmost to see both these conditions fulfilled.\"\\n\\n\"Then follow, for we are losing moments that are as precious as the\\nheart\\'s blood to a stricken deer!\"\\n\\nHeyward could distinguish the impatient gesture of the scout, through\\nthe increasing shadows of the evening, and he moved in his footsteps,\\nswiftly, towards the place where he had left the remainder of his party.\\nWhen they rejoined the expecting and anxious females, he briefly\\nacquainted them with the conditions of their new guide, and with the\\nnecessity that existed for their hushing every apprehension, in instant\\nand serious exertions. Although his alarming communication was not\\nreceived without much secret terror by the listeners, his earnest and\\nimpressive manner, aided perhaps by the nature of the danger, succeeded\\nin bracing their nerves to undergo some unlooked-for and unusual trial.\\nSilently, and without a moment\\'s delay, they permitted him to assist\\nthem from their saddles, when they descended quickly to the water\\'s\\nedge, where the scout had collected the rest of the party, more by the\\nagency of expressive gestures than by any use of words.\\n\\n\"What to do with these dumb creatures!\" muttered the white man, on whom\\nthe sole control of their future movements appeared to devolve; \"it\\nwould be time lost to cut their throats, and cast them into the river;\\nand to leave them here, would be to tell the Mingos that they have not\\nfar to seek to find their owners!\"\\n\\n\"Then give them their bridles, and let them range the woods,\" Heyward\\nventured to suggest.\\n\\n\"No; it would be better to mislead the imps, and make them believe they\\nmust equal a horse\\'s speed to run down their chase. Ay, ay, that will\\nblind their fire-balls of eyes! Chingach--Hist? what stirs the bush?\"\\n\\n\"The colt.\"\\n\\n\"That colt, at least, must die,\" muttered the scout, grasping the mane\\nof the nimble beast, which easily eluded his hand; \"Uncas, your arrows!\"\\n\\n\"Hold!\" exclaimed the proprietor of the condemned animal, aloud, without\\nregard to the whispering tones used by the others; \"spare the foal of\\nMiriam! it is the comely offspring of a faithful dam, and would\\nwillingly injure naught.\"\\n\\n\"When men struggle for the single life God has given them,\" said the\\nscout sternly, \"even their own kind seem no more than the beasts of the\\nwood. If you speak again, I shall leave you to the mercy of the Maquas!\\nDraw to your arrow\\'s head, Uncas; we have no time for second blows.\"\\n\\nThe low, muttering sounds of his threatening voice were still audible,\\nwhen the wounded foal, first rearing on its hinder legs, plunged forward\\nto its knees. It was met by Chingachgook, whose knife passed across its\\nthroat quicker than thought, and then precipitating the motions of the\\nstruggling victim, he dashed it into the river, down whose stream it\\nglided away, gasping audibly for breath with its ebbing life. This deed\\nof apparent cruelty, but of real necessity, fell upon the spirits of the\\ntravellers like a terrific warning of the peril in which they stood,\\nheightened as it was by the calm though steady resolution of the actors\\nin the scene. The sisters shuddered and clung closer to each other,\\nwhile Heyward instinctively laid his hand on one of the pistols he had\\njust drawn from their holsters, as he placed himself between his charge\\nand those dense shadows that seemed to draw an impenetrable veil before\\nthe bosom of the forest.\\n\\nThe Indians, however, hesitated not a moment, but taking the bridles,\\nthey led the frightened and reluctant horses into the bed of the river.\\n\\nAt a short distance from the shore they turned, and were soon concealed\\nby the projection of the bank, under the brow of which they moved, in a\\ndirection opposite to the course of the waters. In the meantime, the\\nscout drew a canoe of bark from its place of concealment beneath some\\nlow bushes, whose branches were waving with the eddies of the current,\\ninto which he silently motioned for the females to enter. They complied\\nwithout hesitation, though many a fearful and anxious glance was thrown\\nbehind them towards the thickening gloom which now lay like a dark\\nbarrier along the margin of the stream.\\n\\nSo soon as Cora and Alice were seated, the scout, without regarding the\\nelement, directed Heyward to support one side of the frail vessel, and\\nposting himself at the other, they bore it up against the stream,\\nfollowed by the dejected owner of the dead foal. In this manner they\\nproceeded, for many rods, in a silence that was only interrupted by the\\nrippling of the water, as its eddies played around them, or the low dash\\nmade by their own cautious footsteps. Heyward yielded the guidance of\\nthe canoe implicitly to the scout, who approached or receded from the\\nshore, to avoid the fragments of rocks, or deeper parts of the river,\\nwith a readiness that showed his knowledge of the route they held.\\nOccasionally he would stop; and in the midst of a breathing stillness,\\nthat the dull but increasing roar of the waterfall only served to render\\nmore impressive, he would listen with painful intenseness, to catch any\\nsounds that might arise from the slumbering forest. When assured that\\nall was still, and unable to detect, even by the aid of his practised\\nsenses, any sign of his approaching foes, he would deliberately resume\\nhis slow and unguarded progress. At length they reached a point in the\\nriver, where the roving eye of Heyward became riveted on a cluster of\\nblack objects, collected at a spot where the high bank threw a deeper\\nshadow than usual on the dark waters. Hesitating to advance, he pointed\\nout the place to the attention of his companion.\\n\\n\"Ay,\" returned the composed scout, \"the Indians have hid the beasts\\nwith the judgment of natives! Water leaves no trail, and an owl\\'s eyes\\nwould be blinded by the darkness of such a hole.\"\\n\\nThe whole party was soon reunited, and another consultation was held\\nbetween the scout and his new comrades, during which, they whose fates\\ndepended on the faith and ingenuity of these unknown foresters, had a\\nlittle leisure to observe their situation more minutely.\\n\\nThe river was confined between high and cragged rocks, one of which\\nimpended above the spot where the canoe rested. As these, again, were\\nsurmounted by tall trees, which appeared to totter on the brows of the\\nprecipice, it gave the stream the appearance of running through a deep\\nand narrow dell. All beneath the fantastic limbs and ragged tree-tops,\\nwhich were, here and there, dimly painted against the starry zenith, lay\\nalike in shadowed obscurity. Behind them, the curvature of the banks\\nsoon bounded the view, by the same dark and wooded outline; but in\\nfront, and apparently at no great distance, the water seemed piled\\nagainst the heavens, whence it tumbled into caverns, out of which issued\\nthose sullen sounds that had loaded the evening atmosphere. It seemed,\\nin truth, to be a spot devoted to seclusion, and the sisters imbibed a\\nsoothing impression of security, as they gazed upon its romantic, though\\nnot unappalling beauties. A general movement among their conductors,\\nhowever, soon recalled them from a contemplation of the wild charms that\\nnight had assisted to lend the place, to a painful sense of their real\\nperil.\\n\\nThe horses had been secured to some scattered shrubs that grew in the\\nfissures of the rocks, where, standing in the water, they were left to\\npass the night. The scout directed Heyward and his disconsolate\\nfellow-travellers to seat themselves in the forward end of the canoe,\\nand took possession of the other himself, as erect and steady as if he\\nfloated in a vessel of much firmer materials. The Indians warily\\nretraced their steps towards the place they had left, when the scout,\\nplacing his pole against a rock, by a powerful shove, sent his frail\\nbark directly into the centre of the turbulent stream. For many minutes\\nthe struggle between the light bubble in which they floated, and the\\nswift current, was severe and doubtful. Forbidden to stir even a hand,\\nand almost afraid to breathe, lest they should expose the frail fabric\\nto the fury of the stream, the passengers watched the glancing waters in\\nfeverish suspense. Twenty times they thought the whirling eddies were\\nsweeping them to destruction, when the master-hand of their pilot would\\nbring the bows of the canoe to stem the rapid. A long, a vigorous, and,\\nas it appeared to the females, a desperate effort, closed the struggle.\\nJust as Alice veiled her eyes in horror, under the impression that they\\nwere about to be swept within the vortex at the foot of the cataract,\\nthe canoe floated, stationary, at the side of a flat rock, that lay on a\\nlevel with the water.\\n\\n\"Where are we? and what is next to be done?\" demanded Heyward,\\nperceiving that the exertions of the scout had ceased.\\n\\n\"You are at the foot of Glenn\\'s,\" returned the other, speaking aloud,\\nwithout fear of consequences, within the roar of the cataract; \"and the\\nnext thing is to make a steady landing, lest the canoe upset, and you\\nshould go down again the hard road we have travelled, faster than you\\ncame up; \\'tis a hard rift to stem, when the river is a little swelled;\\nand five is an unnatural number to keep dry, in the hurry-skurry, with a\\nlittle birchen bark and gum. There, go you all on the rock, and I will\\nbring up the Mohicans with the venison. A man had better sleep without\\nhis scalp, than famish in the midst of plenty.\"\\n\\nHis passengers gladly complied with these directions. As the last foot\\ntouched the rock, the canoe whirled from its station, when the tall form\\nof the scout was seen, for an instant, gliding above the waters, before\\nit disappeared in the impenetrable darkness that rested on the bed of\\nthe river. Left by their guide, the travellers remained a few minutes in\\nhelpless ignorance, afraid even to move along the broken rocks, lest a\\nfalse step should precipitate them down some one of the many deep and\\nroaring caverns, into which the water seemed to tumble, on every side of\\nthem. Their suspense, however, was soon relieved; for aided by the skill\\nof the natives, the canoe shot back into the eddy, and floated again at\\nthe side of the low rock before they thought the scout had even time to\\nrejoin his companions.\\n\\n\"We are now fortified, garrisoned, and provisioned,\" cried Heyward,\\ncheerfully, \"and may set Montcalm and his allies at defiance. How, now,\\nmy vigilant sentinel, can you see anything of those you call the\\nIroquois, on the mainland?\"\\n\\n\"I call them Iroquois, because to me every native, who speaks a foreign\\ntongue, is accounted an enemy, though he may pretend to serve the king!\\nIf Webb wants faith and honesty in an Indian, let him bring out the\\ntribes of the Delawares, and send these greedy and lying Mohawks and\\nOneidas, with their six nations of varlets, where in nature they belong,\\namong the French!\"\\n\\n\"We should then exchange a warlike for a useless friend! I have heard\\nthat the Delawares have laid aside the hatchet, and are content to be\\ncalled women!\"\\n\\n\"Ay, shame on the Hollanders[10] and Iroquois, who circumvented them by\\ntheir deviltries, into such a treaty! But I have known them for twenty\\nyears, and I call him liar, that says cowardly blood runs in the veins\\nof a Delaware. You have driven their tribes from the sea-shore, and\\nwould now believe what their enemies say, that you may sleep at night\\nupon an easy pillow. No, no; to me, every Indian who speaks a foreign\\ntongue is an Iroquois, whether the castle[11] of his tribe be in Canada,\\nor be in New York.\"\\n\\nHeyward, perceiving that the stubborn adherence of the scout to the\\ncause of his friends the Delawares or Mohicans, for they were branches\\nof the same numerous people, was likely to prolong a useless discussion,\\nchanged the subject.\\n\\n\"Treaty or no treaty, I know full well, that your two companions are\\nbrave and cautious warriors! have they heard or seen anything of our\\nenemies?\"\\n\\n\"An Indian is a mortal to be felt afore he is seen,\" returned the scout,\\nascending the rock, and throwing the deer carelessly down. \"I trust to\\nother signs than such as come in at the eye, when I am outlying on the\\ntrail of the Mingos.\"\\n\\n\"Do your ears tell you that they have traced our retreat?\"\\n\\n\"I should be sorry to think they had, though this is a spot that stout\\ncourage might hold for a smart skrimmage. I will not deny, however, but\\nthe horses cowered when I passed them, as though they scented the\\nwolves; and a wolf is a beast that is apt to hover about an Indian\\nambushment, craving the offals of the deer the savages kill.\"\\n\\n\"You forget the buck at your feet! or, may we not owe their visit to the\\ndead colt? Ha! what noise is that?\"\\n\\n\"Poor Miriam!\" murmured the stranger; \"thy foal was foreordained to\\nbecome a prey to ravenous beasts!\" Then, suddenly lifting up his voice,\\namid the eternal din of the waters, he sang aloud,--\\n\\n  \"First born of Egypt, smite did He,\\n  Of mankind, and of beast also;\\n  O, Egypt! wonders sent \\'midst thee,\\n  On Pharaoh and his servants too!\"\\n\\n\"The death of the colt sits heavy on the heart of its owner,\" said the\\nscout; \"but it\\'s a good sign to see a man account upon his dumb friends.\\nHe has the religion of the matter, in believing what is to happen will\\nhappen; and with such a consolation, it won\\'t be long afore he submits\\nto the rationality of killing a four-footed beast, to save the lives of\\nhuman men. It may be as you say,\" he continued, reverting to the purport\\nof Heyward\\'s last remark; \"and the greater the reason why we should cut\\nour steaks, and let the carcase drive down the stream, or we shall have\\nthe pack howling along the cliffs, begrudging every mouthful we swallow.\\nBesides, though the Delaware tongue is the same as a book to the\\nIroquois, the cunning varlets are quick enough at understanding the\\nreason of a wolf\\'s howl.\"\\n\\nThe scout, whilst making his remarks, was busied in collecting certain\\nnecessary implements; as he concluded, he moved silently by the group of\\ntravellers, accompanied by the Mohicans, who seemed to comprehend his\\nintentions with instinctive readiness, when the whole three disappeared\\nin succession, seeming to vanish against the dark face of a\\nperpendicular rock, that rose to the height of a few yards within as\\nmany feet of the water\\'s edge.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

He seated himself\\non a projection of the rocks, whence he gave no other signs of\\nconsciousness than by the struggles of his spirit, as manifested in\\nfrequent and heavy sighs. Smothered voices were next heard, as though\\nmen called to each other in the bowels of the earth, when a sudden light\\nflashed upon those without, and laid bare the much-prized secret of the\\nplace.\\n\\nAt the farther extremity of a narrow, deep cavern in the rock, whose\\nlength appeared much extended by the perspective and the nature of the\\nlight by which it was seen, was seated the scout, holding a blazing knot\\nof pine. The strong glare of the fire fell full upon his sturdy,\\nweather-beaten countenance and forest attire, lending an air of romantic\\nwildness to the aspect of an individual, who, seen by the sober light of\\nday, would have exhibited the peculiarities of a man remarkable for the\\nstrangeness of his dress, the iron-like inflexibility of his frame, and\\nthe singular compound of quick, vigilant sagacity, and of exquisite\\nsimplicity, that by turns usurped the possession of his muscular\\nfeatures. At a little distance in advance stood Uncas, his whole person\\nthrown powerfully into view. The travellers anxiously regarded the\\nupright, flexible figure of the young Mohican, graceful and unrestrained\\nin the attitudes and movements of nature. Though his person was more\\nthan usually screened by a green and fringed hunting-shirt, like that of\\nthe white man, there was no concealment to his dark, glancing, fearless\\neye, alike terrible and calm; the bold outline of his high, haughty\\nfeatures, pure in their native red; or to the dignified elevation of his\\nreceding forehead, together with all the finest proportions of a noble\\nhead, bared to the generous scalping tuft. It was the first opportunity\\npossessed by Duncan and his companions, to view the marked lineaments of\\neither of their Indian attendants, and each individual of the party felt\\nrelieved from a burden of doubt, as the proud and determined, though\\nwild expression of the features of the young warrior forced itself on\\ntheir notice. They felt it might be a being partially benighted in the\\nvale of ignorance, but it could not be one who would willingly devote\\nhis rich natural gifts to the purposes of wanton treachery. The\\ningenuous Alice gazed at his free air and proud carriage, as she would\\nhave looked upon some precious relic of the Grecian chisel, to which\\nlife had been imparted by the intervention of a miracle; while Heyward,\\nthough accustomed to see the perfection of form which abounds among the\\nuncorrupted natives, openly expressed his admiration at such an\\nunblemished specimen of the noblest proportions of man.\\n\\n\"I could sleep in peace,\" whispered Alice, in reply, \"with such a\\nfearless and generous looking youth for my sentinel. Surely, Duncan,\\nthose cruel murders, those terrific scenes of torture, of which we read\\nand hear so much, are never acted in the presence of such as he!\"\\n\\n\"This, certainly, is a rare and brilliant instance of those natural\\nqualities, in which these peculiar people are said to excel,\" he\\nanswered. \"I agree with you, Alice, in thinking that such a front and\\neye were formed rather to intimidate than to deceive; but let us not\\npractise a deception upon ourselves, by expecting any other exhibition\\nof what we esteem virtue than according to the fashion of a savage. As\\nbright examples of great qualities are but too uncommon among\\nChristians, so are they singular and solitary with the Indians; though,\\nfor the honor of our common nature, neither are incapable of producing\\nthem. Let us then hope that this Mohican may not disappoint our wishes,\\nbut prove, what his looks assert him to be, a brave and constant\\nfriend.\"\\n\\n\"Now Major Heyward speaks as Major Heyward should,\" said Cora; \"who,\\nthat looks at this creature of nature, remembers the shade of his skin!\"\\n\\nA short, and apparently an embarrassed silence succeeded this remark,\\nwhich was interrupted by the scout calling to them, aloud, to enter.\\n\\n\"This fire begins to show too bright a flame,\" he continued, as they\\ncomplied, \"and might light the Mingos to our undoing. Uncas, drop the\\nblanket, and show the knaves its dark side. This is not such a supper as\\na major of the Royal Americans has a right to expect, but I\\'ve known\\nstout detachments of the corps glad to eat their venison raw, and\\nwithout a relish too.[12] Here, you see, we have plenty of salt, and can\\nmake a quick broil. There\\'s fresh sassafras boughs for the ladies to sit\\non, which may not be as proud as their my-hog-guinea chairs, but which\\nsends up a sweeter flavor than the skin of any hog can do, be it of\\nGuinea, or be it of any other land. Come, friend, don\\'t be mournful for\\nthe colt; \\'twas an innocent thing, and had not seen much hardship. Its\\ndeath will save the creature many a sore back and weary foot!\"\\n\\nUncas did as the other had directed, and when the voice of Hawkeye\\nceased, the roar of the cataract sounded like the rumbling of distant\\nthunder.\\n\\n\"Are we quite safe in this cavern?\" demanded Heyward. \"Is there no\\ndanger of surprise? A single armed man, at its entrance, would hold us\\nat his mercy.\"\\n\\nA spectral-looking figure stalked from out the darkness behind the\\nscout, and seizing a blazing brand, held it towards the farther\\nextremity of their place of retreat. Alice uttered a faint shriek, and\\neven Cora rose to her feet, as this appalling object moved into the\\nlight; but a single word from Heyward calmed them, with the assurance it\\nwas only their attendant, Chingachgook, who, lifting another blanket,\\ndiscovered that the cavern had two outlets. Then, holding the brand, he\\ncrossed a deep, narrow chasm in the rocks, which ran at right angles\\nwith the passage they were in, but which, unlike that, was open to the\\nheavens, and entered another cave, answering to the description of the\\nfirst, in every essential particular.\\n\\n\"Such old foxes as Chingachgook and myself are not often caught in a\\nburrow with one hole,\" said Hawkeye, laughing; \"you can easily see the\\ncunning of the place--the rock is black limestone, which everybody knows\\nis soft; it makes no uncomfortable pillow, where brush and pine wood is\\nscarce; well, the fall was once a few yards below us, and I dare to say\\nwas, in its time, as regular and as handsome a sheet of water as any\\nalong the Hudson. But old age is a great injury to good looks, as these\\nsweet young ladies have yet to l\\'arn! The place is sadly changed! These\\nrocks are full of cracks, and in some places they are softer than at\\nothersome, and the water has worked out deep hollows for itself, until\\nit has fallen back, ay, some hundred feet, breaking here and wearing\\nthere, until the falls have neither shape nor consistency.\"\\n\\n\"In what part of them are we?\" asked Heyward.\\n\\n\"Why, we are nigh the spot that Providence first placed them at, but\\nwhere, it seems, they were too rebellious to stay. The rock proved\\nsofter on each side of us, and so they left the centre of the river bare\\nand dry, first working out these two little holes for us to hide in.\"\\n\\n\"We are then on an island?\"\\n\\n\"Ay! there are the falls on two sides of us, and the river above and\\nbelow. If you had daylight, it would be worth the trouble to step up on\\nthe height of this rock, and look at the perversity of the water. It\\nfalls by no rule at all; sometimes it leaps, sometimes it tumbles;\\nthere, it skips; here, it shoots; in one place \\'tis white as snow, and\\nin another \\'tis green as grass; hereabouts, it pitches into deep\\nhollows, that rumble and quake the \\'arth; and hereaway, it ripples and\\nsings like a brook, fashioning whirlpools and gulleys in the old stone,\\nas it \\'twas no harder than trodden clay. The whole design of the river\\nseems disconcerted. First it runs smoothly, as if meaning to go down the\\ndescent as things were ordered; then it angles about and faces the\\nshores; nor are there places wanting where it looks backward, as if\\nunwilling to leave the wilderness, to mingle with the salt! Ay, lady,\\nthe fine cobweb-looking cloth you wear at your throat, is coarse, and\\nlike a fish-net, to little spots I can show you, where the river\\nfabricates all sorts of images, as if, having broke loose from order, it\\nwould try its hand at everything. And yet what does it amount to! After\\nthe water has been suffered to have its will, for a time, like a\\nheadstrong man, it is gathered together by the hand that made it, and a\\nfew rods below you may see it all, flowing on steadily towards the sea,\\nas was foreordained from the first foundation of the \\'arth!\"\\n\\nWhile his auditors received a cheering assurance of the security of\\ntheir place of concealment, from this untutored description of\\nGlenn\\'s,[13] they were much inclined to judge differently from Hawkeye,\\nof its wild beauties. But they were not in a situation to suffer their\\nthoughts to dwell on the charms of natural objects; and, as the scout\\nhad not found it necessary to cease his culinary labors while he spoke,\\nunless to point out, with a broken fork, the direction of some\\nparticularly obnoxious point in the rebellious stream, they now suffered\\ntheir attention to be drawn to the necessary, though more vulgar\\nconsideration of their supper.\\n\\nThe repast, which was greatly aided by the addition of a few delicacies\\nthat Heyward had the precaution to bring with him when they left their\\nhorses, was exceedingly refreshing to the wearied party. Uncas acted as\\nattendant to the females, performing all the little offices within his\\npower, with a mixture of dignity and anxious grace, that served to amuse\\nHeyward, who well knew that it was an utter innovation on the Indian\\ncustoms, which forbid their warriors to descend to any menial\\nemployment, especially in favor of their women. As the rites of\\nhospitality were, however, considered sacred among them, this little\\ndeparture from the dignity of manhood excited no audible comment. Had\\nthere been one there sufficiently disengaged to become a close observer,\\nhe might have fancied that the services of the young chief were not\\nentirely impartial. That while he tendered to Alice the gourd of sweet\\nwater and the venison in a trencher, neatly carved from the knot of the\\npepperidge, with sufficient courtesy, in performing the same offices to\\nher sister, his dark eye lingered on her rich, speaking countenance.\\nOnce or twice he was compelled to speak, to command the attention of\\nthose he served. In such cases, he made use of English, broken and\\nimperfect, but sufficiently intelligible, and which he rendered so mild\\nand musical, by his deep,[14] guttural voice, that it never failed to\\ncause both ladies to look up in admiration and astonishment. In the\\ncourse of these civilities, a few sentences were exchanged, that served\\nto establish the appearance of an amicable intercourse between the\\nparties.\\n\\nIn the meanwhile, the gravity of Chingachgook remained immovable. He had\\nseated himself more within the circle of light, where the frequent\\nuneasy glances of his guests were better enabled to separate the natural\\nexpression of his face from the artificial terrors of the war-paint.\\nThey found a strong resemblance between father and son, with the\\ndifference that might be expected from age and hardships. The fierceness\\nof his countenance now seemed to slumber, and in its place was to be\\nseen the quiet, vacant composure, which distinguishes an Indian warrior,\\nwhen his faculties are not required for any of the greater purposes of\\nhis existence. It was, however, easy to be seen, by the occasional\\ngleams that shot across his swarthy visage, that it was only necessary\\nto arouse his passions, in order to give full effect to the terrific\\ndevice which he had adopted to intimidate his enemies. On the other\\nhand, the quick, roving eye of the scout seldom rested. He ate and drank\\nwith an appetite that no sense of danger could disturb, but his\\nvigilance seemed never to desert him. Twenty times the gourd or the\\nvenison was suspended before his lips, while his head was turned aside,\\nas though he listened to some distant and distrusted sounds--a movement\\nthat never failed to recall his guests from regarding the novelties of\\ntheir situation, to a recollection of the alarming reasons that had\\ndriven them to seek it. As these frequent pauses were never followed by\\nany remark, the momentary uneasiness they created quickly passed away,\\nand for a time was forgotten.\\n\\n\"Come, friend,\" said Hawkeye, drawing out a keg from beneath a cover of\\nleaves, towards the close of the repast, and addressing the stranger who\\nsat at his elbow, doing great justice to his culinary skill, \"try a\\nlittle spruce; \\'twill wash away all thoughts of the colt, and quicken\\nthe life in your bosom. I drink to our better friendship, hoping that a\\nlittle horse-flesh may leave no heartburnings atween us. How do you name\\nyourself?\"\\n\\n\"Gamut--David Gamut,\" returned the singing-master, preparing to wash\\ndown his sorrows in a powerful draught of the woodman\\'s high-flavored\\nand well-laced compound.\\n\\n\"A very good name, and, I dare say, handed down from honest\\nforefathers. I\\'m an admirator of names, though the Christian fashions\\nfall far below savage customs in this particular. The biggest coward I\\never knew was called Lyon; and his wife, Patience, would scold you out\\nof hearing in less time than a hunted deer would run a rod. With an\\nIndian \\'tis a matter of conscience; what he calls himself, he generally\\nis--not that Chingachgook, which signifies Big Sarpent, is really a\\nsnake, big or little; but that he understands the windings and turnings\\nof human natur\\', and is silent, and strikes his enemies when they least\\nexpect him. What may be your calling?\"\\n\\n\"I am an unworthy instructor in the art of psalmody.\"\\n\\n\"Anan!\"\\n\\n\"I teach singing to the youths, of the Connecticut levy.\"\\n\\n\"You might be better employed. The young hounds go laughing and singing\\ntoo much already through the woods, when they ought not to breathe\\nlouder than a fox in his cover. Can you use the smooth bore, or handle\\nthe rifle?\"\\n\\n\"Praised be God, I have never had occasion to meddle with murderous\\nimplements!\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps you understand the compass, and lay down the water-courses and\\nmountains of the wilderness on paper, in order that they who follow may\\nfind places by their given names?\"\\n\\n\"I practise no such employment.\"\\n\\n\"You have a pair of legs that might make a long path seem short! you\\njourney sometimes, I fancy, with tidings for the general.\"\\n\\n\"Never; I follow no other than my own high vocation, which is\\ninstruction in sacred music!\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis a strange calling!\" muttered Hawkeye, with an inward laugh, \"to go\\nthrough life, like a catbird, mocking all the ups and downs that may\\nhappen to come out of other men\\'s throats. Well, friend, I suppose it is\\nyour gift, and mustn\\'t be denied any more than if \\'twas shooting, or\\nsome other better inclination. Let us hear what you can do in that way;\\n\\'twill be a friendly manner of saying good-night, for \\'tis time that\\nthese ladies should be getting strength for a hard and a long push, in\\nthe pride of the morning, afore the Maquas are stirring!\"\\n\\n\"With joyful pleasure do I consent,\" said David, adjusting his\\niron-rimmed spectacles, and producing his beloved little volume, which\\nhe immediately tendered to Alice. \"What can be more fitting and\\nconsolatory, than to offer up evening praise, after a day of such\\nexceeding jeopardy!\"\\n\\nAlice smiled; but regarding Heyward, she blushed and hesitated.\\n\\n\"Indulge yourself,\" he whispered: \"ought not the suggestion of the\\nworthy namesake of the Psalmist to have its weight at such a moment?\"\\n\\nEncouraged by his opinion, Alice did what her pious inclinations and her\\nkeen relish for gentle sounds, had before so strongly urged. The book\\nwas open at a hymn not ill adapted to their situation, and in which the\\npoet, no longer goaded by his desire to excel the inspired king of\\nIsrael, had discovered some chastened and respectable powers. Cora\\nbetrayed a disposition to support her sister, and the sacred song\\nproceeded, after the indispensable preliminaries of the pitch-pipe and\\nthe tune had been duly attended to by the methodical David.\\n\\nThe air was solemn and slow. At times it rose to the fullest compass of\\nthe rich voices of the females, who hung over their little book in holy\\nexcitement, and again it sank so low, that the rushing of the waters ran\\nthrough their melody, like a hollow accompaniment. The natural taste and\\ntrue ear of David governed and modified the sounds to suit the confined\\ncavern, every crevice, and cranny of which was filled with the thrilling\\nnotes of their flexible voices. The Indians riveted their eyes on the\\nrocks, and listened with an attention that seemed to turn them into\\nstone. But the scout, who had placed his chin in his hand, with an\\nexpression of cold indifference, gradually suffered his rigid features\\nto relax, until, as verse succeeded verse, he felt his iron nature\\nsubdued, while his recollection was carried back to boyhood, when his\\nears had been accustomed to listen to similar sounds of praise, in the\\nsettlements of the colony. His roving eyes began to moisten, and before\\nthe hymn was ended, scalding tears rolled out of fountains that had long\\nseemed dry, and followed each other down those cheeks, that had oftener\\nfelt the storms of heaven than any testimonials of weakness. The singers\\nwere dwelling on one of those low, dying chords, which the ear devours\\nwith such greedy rapture, as if conscious that it is about to lose them,\\nwhen a cry, that seemed neither human nor earthly, rose in the outward\\nair, penetrating not only the recesses of the cavern, but to the inmost\\nhearts of all who heard it. It was followed by a stillness apparently as\\ndeep as if the waters had been checked in their furious progress, at\\nsuch a horrid and unusual interruption.\\n\\n\"What is it?\" murmured Alice, after a few moments of terrible suspense.\\n\\n\"What is it?\" repeated Heyward aloud.\\n\\nNeither Hawkeye nor the Indians made any reply. They listened, as if\\nexpecting the sound would be repeated, with a manner that expressed\\ntheir own astonishment. At length they spoke together earnestly, in the\\nDelaware language, when Uncas, passing by the inner and most concealed\\naperture, cautiously left the cavern. When he had gone, the scout first\\nspoke in English.\\n\\n\"What it is, or what it is not, none here can tell; though two of us\\nhave ranged the woods for more than thirty years! I did believe there\\nwas no cry that Indians or beast could make, that my ears had not heard;\\nbut this has proved that I was only a vain and conceited mortal!\"\\n\\n\"Was it not, then, the shout the warriors make when they wish to\\nintimidate their enemies?\" asked Cora, who stood drawing her veil about\\nher person, with a calmness to which her agitated sister was a stranger.\\n\\n\"No, no; this was bad, and shocking, and had a sort of unhuman sound;\\nbut when you once hear the war-whoop, you will never mistake it for\\nanything else! Well, Uncas!\" speaking in Delaware to the young chief as\\nhe re-entered, \"what see you? do our lights shine through the blankets?\"\\n\\nThe answer was short, and apparently decided, being given in the same\\ntongue.\\n\\n\"There is nothing to be seen without,\" continued Hawkeye, shaking his\\nhead in discontent; \"and our hiding-place is still in darkness! Pass\\ninto the other cave, you that need it, and seek for sleep; we must be\\nafoot long before the sun, and make the most of our time to get to\\nEdward, while the Mingos are taking their morning nap.\"\\n\\nCora set the example of compliance, with a steadiness that taught the\\nmore timid Alice the necessity of obedience. Before leaving the place,\\nhowever, she whispered a request to Duncan that he would follow. Uncas\\nraised the blanket for their passage, and as the sisters turned to thank\\nhim for this act of attention, they saw the scout seated again before\\nthe dying embers, with his face resting on his hands, in a manner which\\nshowed how deeply he brooded on the unaccountable interruption which\\nhad broken up their evening devotions.\\n\\nHeyward took with him a blazing knot, which threw a dim light through\\nthe narrow vista of their new apartment. Placing it in a favorable\\nposition, he joined the females, who now found themselves alone with him\\nfor the first time since they had left the friendly ramparts of Fort\\nEdward.\\n\\n\"Leave us not, Duncan,\" said Alice; \"we cannot sleep in such a place as\\nthis, with that horrid cry still ringing in our ears!\"\\n\\n\"First let us examine into the security of your fortress,\" he answered,\\n\"and then we will speak of rest.\"\\n\\nHe approached the farther end of the cavern, to an outlet, which, like\\nthe others, was concealed by blankets, and removing the thick screen,\\nbreathed the fresh and reviving air from the cataract. One arm of the\\nriver flowed through a deep, narrow ravine, which its current had worn\\nin the soft rock, directly beneath his feet, forming an effectual\\ndefence, as he believed, against any danger from that quarter; the\\nwater, a few rods above them, plunging, glancing, and sweeping along, in\\nits most violent and broken manner.\\n\\n\"Nature has made an impenetrable barrier on this side,\" he continued,\\npointing down the perpendicular declivity into the dark current, before\\nhe dropped the blanket; \"and as you know that good men and true are on\\nguard in front, I see no reason why the advice of our honest host should\\nbe disregarded. I am certain Cora will join me in saying that sleep is\\nnecessary to you both.\"\\n\\n\"Cora may submit to the justice of your opinion, though she cannot put\\nit in practise,\" returned the elder sister, who had placed herself by\\nthe side of Alice, on a couch of sassafras; \"there would be other causes\\nto chase away sleep, though we had been spared the shock of this\\nmysterious noise. Ask yourself, Heyward, can daughters forget the\\nanxiety a father must endure, whose children lodge, he knows not where\\nor how, in such a wilderness, and in the midst of so many perils?\"\\n\\n\"He is a soldier, and knows how to estimate the chances of the woods.\"\\n\\n\"He is a father, and cannot deny his nature.\"\\n\\n\"How kind has he ever been to all my follies! how tender and indulgent\\nto all my wishes!\" sobbed Alice. \"We have been selfish, sister, in\\nurging our visit at such hazard!\"\\n\\n\"I may have been rash in pressing his consent in a moment of much\\nembarrassment, but I would have proved to him, that however others might\\nneglect him in his strait, his children at least were faithful!\"\\n\\n\"When he heard of your arrival at Edward,\" said Heyward, kindly, \"there\\nwas a powerful struggle in his bosom between fear and love; though the\\nlatter, heightened, if possible, by so long a separation, quickly\\nprevailed. \\'It is the spirit of my noble-minded Cora that leads them,\\nDuncan,\\' he said, \\'and I will not balk it. Would to God, that he who\\nholds the honor of our royal master in his guardianship, would show but\\nhalf her firmness!\\'\"\\n\\n\"And did he not speak of me, Heyward?\" demanded Alice, with jealous\\naffection. \"Surely, he forgot not altogether his little Elsie?\"\\n\\n\"That was impossible,\" returned the young man; \"he called you by a\\nthousand endearing epithets, that I may not presume to use, but to the\\njustice of which I can warmly testify. Once, indeed, he said--\"\\n\\nDuncan ceased speaking; for while his eyes were riveted on those of\\nAlice, who had turned towards him with the eagerness of filial\\naffection, to catch his words, the same strong horrid cry, as before,\\nfilled the air, and rendered him mute. A long, breathless silence\\nsucceeded, during which each looked at the others in fearful expectation\\nof hearing the sound repeated. At length the blanket was slowly raised,\\nand the scout stood in the aperture with a countenance whose firmness\\nevidently began to give way, before a mystery that seemed to threaten\\nsome danger, against which all his cunning and experience might prove of\\nno avail.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "   'summary_text': 'Heyward and the girls are uneasy and Gamut is still struggling in spirit when a light flashes upon them and they see that the others have entered a cavern hidden by a blanket. Hawkeye is holding a blazing knot of pine which silhouettes Uncas, the first clear sight of whose carriage and almost Grecian features relieves the lingering doubts of those from Fort Edward. When the latter also enter the cavern, they learn that at the other entrance is a narrow, open chasm running at right angles and that just beyond it is another cave. They are essentially on an island of rock with the falls and turbulent water on both sides. As they take their meal of venison, Uncas makes an innovation on his Indian customs by attending the females, betraying a bit more interest in Cora than in Alice. In spite of his continuous vigilance, Hawkeye draws out a keg and invites Gamut to \"try a little spruce.\" After they discuss Gamut\\'s name and profession, the psalmodist and the girls render a sacred number that is safely muffled by the noise of the falls. The memory of his boyhood in the settlements brings tears to the scout\\'s eyes just as the song is interrupted by a sudden, unearthly cry. In the ensuing stillness, Uncas cautiously steps outside but can see nothing to identify the unknown sound. Heyward takes the girls into the inner cave for sleep and inspects the far entrance to find directly beneath his feet an impenetrable barrier of roiling water. Though yet stoical, Cora seems for the first time to feel it rash to be trying to visit their father during this crisis. Heyward is reassuring the girls about Munro\\'s feelings for them when the horrid cry fills the air again. Within a moment, the blanket-entrance is raised and the scout stands there, his face reflecting everyone\\'s fearful sense of mystery and his own growing dismay.',\n",
       "   'summary_analysis': 'This chapter shows Cooper in his most inventive, dramatic, and descriptive form. His sympathy and admiration for the good Indians ring through his own delineations and the appreciative words of Heyward, Alice, and Cora. By putting the poetic description of the island and falls into the mouth of Hawkeye, he reveals his deep respect for and clear knowledge of nature and at the same time deepens the characterization of the scout, whose sense of justice, relativity, and \"place\" is again highlighted when he admits that Gamut\\'s \"strange calling\" is his \"gift\" and must not be denied. Completing and technically sustaining these developments are the plot elements of suspense and exploration of locale. Preparation for future thematic plot complications is smooth and unobtrusive in Uncas\\' brief attention to Cora.',\n",

As Heyward remarks upon the loveliness of the scene, the horrifying sound comes again as if from the bed of the river, and Heyward now recognizes it as the shriek of a horse in terror. The scout\\'s reckoning that the horses are frightened by hovering wolves is immediately confirmed by a long howl that swiftly recedes into the depths of the forest, an abandonment that indicates enemy Indians are near. Once again secure in his knowledge of things, Hawkeye directs everyone to hide in moon shadows where they have a full view of both shores. Hours pass, and all fall asleep except the ever watchful scout and the Mohicans. The moon sets, and as pale dawn begins, the Iroquois attack with hellish yells and rifle reports. Gamut exposes himself, is wounded, and falls unconscious, while Hawkeye slips below and shoots one enemy, afterwards saying that their only hope is to hold the rock until Munro sends a party to help them. Heyward takes the girls into the outer cave where the reviving Gamut has been taken. As Cora reminds him how much his safety means to them, the major glances at Alice, reassures them, and rejoins the others outside. He and the scout deploy themselves in a little thicket of pines below the rock that splits the falls. Dawn comes. Then a long, anxious, and quiet watch succeeds until Hawkeye detects that four Indians have swum dangerously down to the rock above the defenders. As they wait, a fifth one, struggling to reach the rock, is thrown into the air and over the falls with a single, despairing shriek. After whistling Uncas to them, Hawkeye and the warrior shoot two Indians as the four charge them. When Heyward\\'s pistols misfire, he and the scout grapple hand-to-hand with the two remaining enemies until Hawkeye dispatches his foe with a knife. Heyward is about to be dragged over the precipice with the other when Uncas severs the tendons of the Iroquois\\' wrist and grabs Heyward as the wounded savage falls to his destruction. As the survivors take cover, the Indians on shore yell and fire, and a give-and-take battle begins. One Iroquois, who has climbed an oak tree near shore, fires down upon the protagonists and slightly wounds Heyward. Setting up a crossfire with Chingachgook, Hawkeye fires his rifle \\\\\"Killdeer\\\\\" and wounds the savage, who is left swinging in the wind with a desperate grasp on a branch. To save powder, the scout refuses to show mercy and finish the kill, but he weakens and discharges his last powder and bullet as the man falls toward the rocks and water. Uncas goes for munitions in the canoe only to find an Indian swimming away with it. Now essentially bereft of defensive means, the Mohicans scoff at their enemies and prepare for death. Hawkeye is quietly and stoically preparing himself also when Cora, who has been brave all along, entreats the men to escape downstream and effect a rescue. Convinced of her reason, Chingachgook slips under the water and away. After telling her to leave a marked trail if they are captured, Hawkeye carefully lays \\\\\"Killdeer\\\\\" aside and disappears into the water. Uncas remains until Cora, lowering her eyes, asks him to go to her father as her \\\\\"most confidential\\\\\" messenger; then he also drops into the water. When Heyward refuses to leave on the grounds that his presence may keep the girls from evils worse than death, Cora draws \\\\\"the nearly insensible Alice after her into the deepest recess of the inner cavern.\\\\\"\", \"analysis\": \"While outwardly these two chapters are concerned chiefly with fright and action for entertaining the reader and multiplying difficulties for the characters, it also portrays the bloody cross-purposes of frontier strife: seven Iroquois are killed and two white men are wounded, while the male protagonists are finally confronted with a moral dilemma. Are they to face danger and probable death with calm, frontal bravery, or are they to turn to subterfuge and escape, hoping to effect a rescue but running the risk of being deserters? It is a bigger problem than that found in most sentimental novels, where woman\\'s greatest threat is usually to her virtue or reputation. Here it involves the age-old physical responsibility of the male for the female and -- greater yet -- of the strong for the weak, the typical assumption in the myth of the American frontiersman. The decision and resultant escape of Hawkeye, whose Christian reasoning is notably different from that of the Mohicans, is of a piece with the American self-ideal about necessity and the ingenuity of \\\\\"finding a way out.\\\\\" The fortitude of Cora at this point is also consistent with the accredited strength of American pioneer womanhood; it is she who sees beyond the immediate grave situation to a possible desperate solution for which she femininely entreats rather than insists. Further, though Cooper\\'s females only seldom do so, in this instance Cora takes on the three-dimensional qualities of a real woman character when, revealing a bit of her personal feelings and utilizing Uncas\\', she urges the subtle distinction about messengers which leads the young Mohican to escape also. At his best, Cooper is not a novelist who presses his thematic elements very hard upon his reader. But the preceding elements are in these two chapters, and so are others such as the rifle lore that Hawkeye voices during the battles. The two white men from Fort Edward are significantly wounded in this raw frontier condition that is new to them. Although as yet unaware of it, Gamut is already confronting what Hawkeye knows and, after the psalmodist is unconscious, voices: that \\\\\"singing won\\'t do any good with the Iroquois.\\\\\" Thus in the singing master, religious idealism and reality are meeting head-on. Also, Cooper is very slowly and carefully developing the attraction between Uncas and Cora. The surplus sentimental heroine is gradually being paired with a hero, but it is an original pairing that involves the conservative idea of racial \\\\\"place\\\\\" and is to result in tragic complications. While the story moves along at a brisk pace with action and Indian customs such as the preparation for dying, Cooper is touching upon and getting ready to develop further more crucial aspects of the frontier situation in the New World.\"}',\n",
       "   'chapter': '\\n                  \"They do not sleep.\\n  On yonder cliffs, a grisly band,\\n  I see them sit.\"\\n\\n  GRAY.\\n\\n\\n\"\\'Twould be neglecting a warning that is given for our good, to lie hid\\nany longer,\" said Hawkeye, \"when such sounds are raised in the forest!\\nThe gentle ones may keep close, but the Mohicans and I will watch upon\\nthe rock, where I suppose a major of the 60th would wish to keep us\\ncompany.\"\\n\\n\"Is then our danger so pressing?\" asked Cora.\\n\\n\"He who makes strange sounds, and gives them out for man\\'s information,\\nalone knows our danger. I should think myself wicked, unto rebellion\\nagainst his will, was I to burrow with such warnings in the air! Even\\nthe weak soul who passes his days in singing, is stirred by the cry,\\nand, as he says, is \\'ready to go forth to the battle.\\' If \\'twere only a\\nbattle, it would be a thing understood by us all, and easily managed;\\nbut I have heard that when such shrieks are atween heaven and \\'arth, it\\nbetokens another sort of warfare!\"\\n\\n\"If all our reasons for fear, my friend, are confined to such as proceed\\nfrom supernatural causes, we have but little occasion to be alarmed,\"\\ncontinued the undisturbed Cora; \"are you certain that our enemies have\\nnot invented some new and ingenious method to strike us with terror,\\nthat their conquest may become more easy?\"\\n\\n\"Lady,\" returned the scout, solemnly, \"I have listened to all the sounds\\nof the woods for thirty years, as a man will listen, whose life and\\ndeath depend on the quickness of his ears. There is no whine of the\\npanther, no whistle of the catbird, nor any invention of the devilish\\nMingos, that can cheat me! I have heard the forest moan like mortal men\\nin their affliction; often, and again, have I listened to the wind\\nplaying its music in the branches of the girdled trees; and I have heard\\nthe lightning cracking in the air, like the snapping of blazing brush,\\nas it spitted forth sparks and forked flames; but never have I thought\\nthat I heard more than the pleasure of Him who sported with the things\\nof his hand. But neither the Mohicans, nor I, who am a white man without\\na cross, can explain the cry just heard. We, therefore, believe it a\\nsign given for our good.\"\\n\\n\"It is extraordinary!\" said Heyward, taking his pistols from the place\\nwhere he had laid them on entering; \"be it a sign of peace or a signal\\nof war, it must be looked to. Lead the way, my friend; I follow.\"\\n\\nOn issuing from their place of confinement, the whole party instantly\\nexperienced a grateful renovation of spirits, by exchanging the pent air\\nof the hiding-place for the cool and invigorating atmosphere, which\\nplayed around the whirlpools and pitches of the cataract. A heavy\\nevening breeze swept along the surface of the river, and seemed to drive\\nthe roar of the falls into the recesses of their own caverns, whence it\\nissued heavily and constant, like thunder rumbling beyond the distant\\nhills. The moon had risen, and its light was already glancing here and\\nthere on the waters above them; but the extremity of the rock where they\\nstood still lay in shadow. With the exception of the sounds produced by\\nthe rushing waters, and an occasional breathing of the air, as it\\nmurmured past them in fitful currents, the scene was as still as night\\nand solitude could make it. In vain were the eyes of each individual\\nbent along the opposite shores, in quest of some signs of life, that\\nmight explain the nature of the interruption they had heard. Their\\nanxious and eager looks were baffled by the deceptive light, or rested\\nonly on naked rocks, and straight and immovable trees.\\n\\n\"There is nothing to be seen but the gloom and quiet of a lovely\\nevening,\" whispered Duncan: \"how much should we prize such a scene, and\\nall this breathing solitude, at any other moment, Cora! Fancy yourselves\\nin security and what now, perhaps, increases your terror, may be made\\nconducive to enjoyment--\"\\n\\n\"Listen!\" interrupted Alice.\\n\\nThe caution was unnecessary. Once more the same sound arose, as if from\\nthe bed of the river, and having broken out of the narrow bounds of the\\ncliffs, was heard undulating through the forest, in distant and dying\\ncadences.\\n\\n\"Can any here give a name to such a cry?\" demanded Hawkeye, when the\\nlast echo was lost in the woods; \"if so, let him speak; for myself, I\\njudge it not to belong to \\'arth!\"\\n\\n\"Here, then, is one who can undeceive you,\" said Duncan; \"I know the\\nsound full well, for often have I heard it on the field of battle, and\\nin situations which are frequent in a soldier\\'s life. \\'Tis the horrid\\nshriek that a horse will give in his agony; oftener drawn from him in\\npain, though sometimes in terror. My charger is either a prey to the\\nbeasts of the forest, or he sees his danger, without the power to avoid\\nit. The sound might deceive me in the cavern, but in the open air I know\\nit too well to be wrong.\"\\n\\nThe scout and his companions listened to this simple explanation with\\nthe interest of men who imbibe new ideas, at the same time that they get\\nrid of old ones, which had proved disagreeable inmates. The two latter\\nuttered their usual and expressive exclamation, \"Hugh!\" as the truth\\nfirst glanced upon their minds, while the former, after a short musing\\npause, took upon himself to reply.\\n\\n\"I cannot deny your words,\" he said; \"for I am little skilled in horses,\\nthough born where they abound. The wolves must be hovering above their\\nheads on the bank, and the timorsome creatures are calling on man for\\nhelp, in the best manner they are able. Uncas,\"--he spoke in\\nDelaware--\"Uncas, drop down in the canoe, and whirl a brand among the\\npack; or fear may do what the wolves can\\'t get at to perform, and leave\\nus without horses in the morning, when we shall have so much need to\\njourney swiftly!\"\\n\\nThe young native had already descended to the water, to comply, when a\\nlong howl was raised on the edge of the river, and was borne swiftly off\\ninto the depths of the forest, as though the beasts, of their own\\naccord, were abandoning their prey in sudden terror. Uncas, with\\ninstinctive quickness, receded, and the three foresters held another of\\ntheir low, earnest conferences.\\n\\n\"We have been like hunters who have lost the points of the heavens, and\\nfrom whom the sun has been hid for days,\" said Hawkeye, turning away\\nfrom his companions; \"now we begin again to know the signs of our\\ncourse, and the paths are cleared from briers! Seat yourselves in the\\nshade which the moon throws from yonder beech--\\'tis thicker than that of\\nthe pines--and let us wait for that which the Lord may choose to send\\nnext. Let all your conversation be in whispers; though it would be\\nbetter, and perhaps, in the end, wiser, if each one held discourse with\\nhis own thoughts, for a time.\"\\n\\nThe manner of the scout was seriously impressive, though no longer\\ndistinguished by any signs of unmanly apprehension. It was evident that\\nhis momentary weakness had vanished with the explanation of a mystery\\nwhich his own experience had not served to fathom; and though he now\\nfelt all the realities of their actual condition, that he was prepared\\nto meet them with the energy of his hardy nature. This feeling seemed\\nalso common to the natives, who placed themselves in positions which\\ncommanded a full view of both shores, while their own persons were\\neffectually concealed from observation. In such circumstances, common\\nprudence dictated that Heyward and his companions should imitate a\\ncaution that proceeded from so intelligent a source. The young man drew\\na pile of the sassafras from the cave, and placing it in the chasm which\\nseparated the two caverns, it was occupied by the sisters, who were thus\\nprotected by the rocks from any missiles, while their anxiety was\\nrelieved by the assurance that no danger could approach without a\\nwarning. Heyward himself was posted at hand, so near that he might\\ncommunicate with his companions without raising his voice to a dangerous\\nelevation, while David, in imitation of the woodsmen, bestowed his\\nperson in such a manner among the fissures of the rocks, that his\\nungainly limbs were no longer offensive to the eye.\\n\\nIn this manner, hours passed by without further interruption. The moon\\nreached the zenith, and shed its mild light perpendicularly on the\\nlovely sight of the sisters slumbering peacefully in each other\\'s arms.\\nDuncan cast the wide shawl of Cora before a spectacle he so much loved\\nto contemplate, and then suffered his own head to seek a pillow on the\\nrock. David began to utter sounds that would have shocked his delicate\\norgans in more wakeful moments; in short, all but Hawkeye and the\\nMohicans lost every idea of consciousness, in uncontrollable drowsiness.\\nBut the watchfulness of these vigilant protectors neither tired nor\\nslumbered. Immovable as that rock, of which each appeared to form a\\npart, they lay, with their eyes roving, without intermission, along the\\ndark margin of trees that bounded the adjacent shores of the narrow\\nstream. Not a sound escaped them; the most subtle examination could not\\nhave told they breathed. It was evident that this excess of caution\\nproceeded from an experience that no subtlety on the part of their\\nenemies could deceive. It was, however, continued without any apparent\\nconsequences, until the moon had set, and a pale streak above the\\ntree-tops, at the bend of the river a little below, announced the\\napproach of day.\\n\\nThen, for the first time, Hawkeye was seen to stir. He crawled along\\nthe rock, and shook Duncan from his heavy slumbers.\\n\\n\"Now is the time to journey,\" he whispered; \"awake the gentle ones, and\\nbe ready to get into the canoe when I bring it to the landing-place.\"\\n\\n\"Have you had a quiet night?\" said Heyward; \"for myself, I believe sleep\\nhas got the better of my vigilance.\"\\n\\n\"All is yet still as midnight. Be silent, but be quick.\"\\n\\nBy this time Duncan was thoroughly awake, and he immediately lifted the\\nshawl from the sleeping females. The motion caused Cora to raise her\\nhand as if to repulse him, while Alice murmured, in her soft, gentle\\nvoice, \"No, no, dear father, we were not deserted; Duncan was with us!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sweet innocence,\" whispered the youth; \"Duncan is here, and while\\nlife continues or danger remains, he will never quit thee. Cora! Alice!\\nawake! The hour has come to move!\"\\n\\nA loud shriek from the younger of the sisters, and the form of the other\\nstanding upright before him, in bewildered horror, was the unexpected\\nanswer he received. While the words were still on the lips of Heyward,\\nthere had arisen such a tumult of yells and cries as served to drive the\\nswift currents of his own blood back from its bounding course into the\\nfountains of his heart. It seemed, for near a minute, as if demons of\\nhell had possessed themselves of the air about them, and were venting\\ntheir savage humors in barbarous sounds. The cries came from no\\nparticular direction, though it was evident they filled the woods, and\\nas the appalled listeners easily imagined, the caverns of the falls, the\\nrocks, the bed of the river, and the upper air. David raised his tall\\nperson in the midst of the infernal din, with a hand on either ear,\\nexclaiming--\\n\\n\"Whence comes this discord! Has hell broke loose, that man should utter\\nsounds like these!\"\\n\\nThe bright flashes and the quick reports of a dozen rifles, from the\\nopposite banks of the stream, followed this incautious exposure of his\\nperson, and left the unfortunate singing-master senseless on that rock\\nwhere he had been so long slumbering. The Mohicans boldly sent back the\\nintimidating yell of their enemies, who raised a shout of savage triumph\\nat the fall of Gamut. The flash of rifles was then quick and close\\nbetween them, but either party was too well skilled to leave even a limb\\nexposed to the hostile aim. Duncan listened with intense anxiety for\\nthe strokes of the paddle, believing that flight was now their only\\nrefuge. The river glanced by with its ordinary velocity, but the canoe\\nwas nowhere to be seen on its dark waters. He had just fancied they were\\ncruelly deserted by the scout, as a stream of flame issued from the rock\\nbeneath him, and a fierce yell, blended with a shriek of agony,\\nannounced that the messenger of death, sent from the fatal weapon of\\nHawkeye, had found a victim. At this slight repulse the assailants\\ninstantly withdrew, and gradually the place became as still as before\\nthe sudden tumult.\\n\\nDuncan seized the favorable moment to spring to the body of Gamut, which\\nhe bore within the shelter of the narrow chasm that protected the\\nsisters. In another minute the whole party was collected in this spot of\\ncomparative safety.\\n\\n\"The poor fellow has saved his scalp,\" said Hawkeye, coolly passing his\\nhand over the head of David; \"but he is a proof that a man may be born\\nwith too long a tongue! \\'Twas downright madness to show six feet of\\nflesh and blood, on a naked rock, to the raging savages. I only wonder\\nhe has escaped with life.\"\\n\\n\"Is he not dead!\" demanded Cora, in a voice whose husky tones showed how\\npowerfully natural horror struggled with her assumed firmness. \"Can we\\ndo aught to assist the wretched man?\"\\n\\n\"No, no! the life is in his heart yet, and after he has slept awhile he\\nwill come to himself, and be a wiser man for it, till the hour of his\\nreal time shall come,\" returned Hawkeye, casting another oblique glance\\nat the insensible body, while he filled his charger with admirable\\nnicety. \"Carry him in, Uncas, and lay him on the sassafras. The longer\\nhis nap lasts the better it will be for him, as I doubt whether he can\\nfind a proper cover for such a shape on these rocks; and singing won\\'t\\ndo any good with the Iroquois.\"\\n\\n\"You believe, then, the attack will be renewed?\" asked Heyward.\\n\\n\"Do I expect a hungry wolf will satisfy his craving with a mouthful!\\nThey have lost a man, and \\'tis their fashion, when they meet a loss, and\\nfail in the surprise, to fall back; but we shall have them on again,\\nwith new expedients to circumvent us, and master our scalps. Our main\\nhope,\" he continued, raising his rugged countenance, across which a\\nshade of anxiety just then passed like a darkening cloud, \"will be to\\nkeep the rock until Munro can send a party to our help! God send it may\\nbe soon, and under a leader that knows the Indian customs!\"\\n\\n\"You hear our probable fortunes, Cora,\" said Duncan, \"and you know we\\nhave everything to hope from the anxiety and experience of your father.\\nCome, then, with Alice, into this cavern, where you, at least, will be\\nsafe from the murderous rifles of our enemies and where you may bestow a\\ncare suited to your gentle natures on our unfortunate comrade.\"\\n\\nThe sisters followed him into the outer cave, where David was beginning,\\nby his sighs, to give symptoms of returning consciousness; and then\\ncommending the wounded man to their attention, he immediately prepared\\nto leave them.\\n\\n\"Duncan!\" said the tremulous voice of Cora, when he had reached the\\nmouth of the cavern. He turned, and beheld the speaker, whose color had\\nchanged to a deadly paleness, and whose lip quivered, gazing after him,\\nwith an expression of interest which immediately recalled him to her\\nside. \"Remember, Duncan, how necessary your safety is to our own--how\\nyou bear a father\\'s sacred trust--how much depends on your discretion\\nand care--in short,\" she added, while the tell-tale blood stole over her\\nfeatures, crimsoning her very temples, \"how very deservedly dear you are\\nto all of the name of Munro.\"\\n\\n\"If anything could add to my own base love of life,\" said Heyward,\\nsuffering his unconscious eyes to wander to the youthful form of the\\nsilent Alice, \"it would be so kind an assurance. As major of the 60th,\\nour honest host will tell you I must take my share of the fray; but our\\ntask will be easy; it is merely to keep these blood-hounds at bay for a\\nfew hours.\"\\n\\nWithout waiting for reply, he tore himself from the presence of the\\nsisters, and joined the scout and his companions, who still lay within\\nthe protection of the little chasm between the two caves.\\n\\n\"I tell you, Uncas,\" said the former, as Heyward joined them, \"you are\\nwasteful of your powder, and the kick of the rifle disconcerts your aim!\\nLittle powder, light lead, and a long arm, seldom fail of bringing the\\ndeath screech from a Mingo! At least, such has been my experience with\\nthe creatur\\'s. Come, friends; let us to our covers, for no man can tell\\nwhen or where a Maqua[15] will strike his blow.\"\\n\\nThe Indians silently repaired to their appointed stations, which were\\nfissures in the rocks, whence they could command the approaches to the\\nfoot of the falls. In the centre of the little island, a few short and\\nstunted pines had found root, forming a thicket, into which Hawkeye\\ndarted with the swiftness of a deer, followed by the active Duncan. Here\\nthey secured themselves, as well as circumstances would permit, among\\nthe shrubs and fragments of stone that were scattered about the place.\\nAbove them was a bare, rounded rock, on each side of which the water\\nplayed its gambols, and plunged into the abysses beneath, in the manner\\nalready described. As the day had now dawned, the opposite shores no\\nlonger presented a confused outline, but they were able to look into the\\nwoods, and distinguish objects beneath the canopy of gloomy pines.\\n\\nA long and anxious watch succeeded, but without any further evidences of\\na renewed attack; and Duncan began to hope that their fire had proved\\nmore fatal than was supposed, and that their enemies had been\\neffectually repulsed. When he ventured to utter this impression to his\\ncompanion, it was met by Hawkeye with an incredulous shake of the head.\\n\\n\"You know not the nature of a Maqua, if you think he is so easily beaten\\nback without a scalp!\" he answered. \"If there was one of the imps\\nyelling this morning, there were forty! and they know our number and\\nquality too well to give up the chase so soon. Hist! look into the water\\nabove, just where it breaks over the rocks. I am no mortal, if the risky\\ndevils haven\\'t swam down upon the very pitch, and, as bad luck would\\nhave it, they have hit the head of the island. Hist! man, keep close! or\\nthe hair will be off your crown in the turning of a knife!\"\\n\\nHeyward lifted his head from the cover, and beheld what he justly\\nconsidered a prodigy of rashness and skill. The river had worn away the\\nedge of the soft rock in such a manner, as to render its first pitch\\nless abrupt and perpendicular than is usual at waterfalls. With no other\\nguide than the ripple of the stream where it met the head of the island,\\na party of their insatiable foes had ventured into the current, and swam\\ndown upon this point, knowing the ready access it would give, if\\nsuccessful, to their intended victims. As Hawkeye ceased speaking, four\\nhuman heads could be seen peering above a few logs of drift-wood that\\nhad lodged on these naked rocks, and which had probably suggested the\\nidea of the practicability of the hazardous undertaking. At the next\\nmoment, a fifth form was seen floating over the green edge of the fall,\\na little from the line of the island. The savage struggled powerfully to\\ngain the point of safety, and, favored by the glancing water, he was\\nalready stretching forth an arm to meet the grasp of his companions,\\nwhen he shot away again with the whirling current, appeared to rise into\\nthe air, with uplifted arms and starting eyeballs, and fell, with a\\nsullen plunge, into that deep and yawning abyss over which he hovered. A\\nsingle, wild, despairing shriek rose from the cavern, and all was hushed\\nagain, as the grave.\\n\\nThe first generous impulse of Duncan was to rush to the rescue of the\\nhapless wretch; but he felt himself bound to the spot by the iron grasp\\nof the immovable scout.\\n\\n\"Would ye bring certain death upon us, by telling the Mingos where we\\nlie?\" demanded Hawkeye, sternly; \"\\'tis a charge of powder saved, and\\nammunition is as precious now as breath to a worried deer! Freshen the\\npriming of your pistols--the mist of the falls is apt to dampen the\\nbrimstone--and stand firm for a close struggle, while I fire on their\\nrush.\"\\n\\nHe placed his finger in his mouth, and drew a long, shrill whistle,\\nwhich was answered from the rocks that were guarded by the Mohicans.\\nDuncan caught glimpses of heads above the scattered drift-wood, as this\\nsignal rose on the air, but they disappeared again as suddenly as they\\nhad glanced upon his sight. A low, rustling sound next drew his\\nattention behind him, and turning his head, he beheld Uncas within a few\\nfeet, creeping to his side. Hawkeye spoke to him in Delaware, when the\\nyoung chief took his position with singular caution and undisturbed\\ncoolness. To Heyward this was a moment of feverish and impatient\\nsuspense; though the scout saw fit to select it as a fit occasion to\\nread a lecture to his more youthful associates on the art of using\\nfire-arms with discretion.\\n\\n\"Of all we\\'pons,\" he commenced, \"the long-barrelled, true-grooved,\\nsoft-metalled rifle is the most dangerous in skilful hands, though it\\nwants a strong arm, a quick eye, and great judgment in charging, to put\\nforth all its beauties. The gunsmiths can have but little insight into\\ntheir trade, when they make their fowling-pieces and short horsemen\\'s--\"\\n\\nHe was interrupted by the low but expressive \"Hugh!\" of Uncas.\\n\\n[Illustration: _Copyright by Charles Scribner\\'s Sons_\\n\\nTHE BATTLE AT GLENS FALLS\\n\\n_Each of the combatants threw all his energies into that effort, and the\\nresult was, that both tottered on the brink of the precipice_]\\n\\n\"I see them, boy, I see them!\" continued Hawkeye; \"they are gathering\\nfor the rush, or they would keep their dingy backs below the logs. Well,\\nlet them,\" he added, examining his flint; \"the leading man certainly\\ncomes on to his death, though it should be Montcalm himself!\"\\n\\nAt that moment the woods were filled with another burst of cries, and at\\nthe signal four savages sprang from the cover of the drift-wood. Heyward\\nfelt a burning desire to rush forward to meet them, so intense was the\\ndelirious anxiety of the moment; but he was restrained by the deliberate\\nexamples of the scout and Uncas. When their foes who leaped over the\\nblack rock that divided them, with long bounds, uttering the wildest\\nyells, were within a few rods, the rifle of Hawkeye slowly rose among\\nthe shrubs, and poured out its fatal contents. The foremost Indian\\nbounded like a stricken deer, and fell headlong among the clefts of the\\nisland.\\n\\n\"Now, Uncas!\" cried the scout, drawing his long knife, while his quick\\neyes began to flash with ardor, \"take the last of the screeching imps;\\nof the other two we are sartain!\"\\n\\nHe was obeyed; and but two enemies remained to be overcome. Heyward had\\ngiven one of his pistols to Hawkeye, and together they rushed down a\\nlittle declivity towards their foes; they discharged their weapons at\\nthe same instant, and equally without success.\\n\\n\"I know\\'d it! and I said it!\" muttered the scout, whirling the despised\\nlittle implement over the falls with bitter disdain. \"Come on, ye bloody\\nminded hell-hounds! ye meet a man without a cross!\"\\n\\nThe words were barely uttered, when he encountered a savage of gigantic\\nstature, and of the fiercest mien. At the same moment, Duncan found\\nhimself engaged with the other, in a similar contest of hand to hand.\\nWith ready skill, Hawkeye and his antagonist each grasped that uplifted\\narm of the other which held the dangerous knife. For near a minute they\\nstood looking one another in the eye, and gradually exerting the power\\nof their muscles for the mastery. At length, the toughened sinews of the\\nwhite man prevailed over the less practised limbs of the native. The arm\\nof the latter slowly gave way before the increasing force of the scout,\\nwho suddenly wresting his armed hand from the grasp of the foe, drove\\nthe sharp weapon through his naked bosom to the heart. In the meantime\\nHeyward had been pressed in a more deadly struggle. His slight sword was\\nsnapped in the first encounter. As he was destitute of any other means\\nof defence, his safety now depended entirely on bodily strength and\\nresolution. Though deficient in neither of these qualities, he had met\\nan enemy every way his equal. Happily, he soon succeeded in disarming\\nhis adversary, whose knife fell on the rock at their feet; and from this\\nmoment it became a fierce struggle, who should cast the other over the\\ndizzy height into a neighboring cavern of the falls. Every successive\\nstruggle brought them nearer to the verge, where Duncan perceived the\\nfinal and conquering effort must be made. Each of the combatants threw\\nall his energies into that effort, and the result was, that both\\ntottered on the brink of the precipice. Heyward felt the grasp of the\\nother at his throat, and saw the grim smile the savage gave, under the\\nrevengeful hope that he hurried his enemy to a fate similar to his own,\\nas he felt his body slowly yielding to a resistless power, and the young\\nman experienced the passing agony of such a moment in all its horrors.\\nAt that instant of extreme danger, a dark hand and glancing knife\\nappeared before him; the Indian released his hold, as the blood flowed\\nfreely from around the several tendons of the wrist; and while Duncan\\nwas drawn backward by the saving arm of Uncas, his charmed eyes were\\nstill riveted on the fierce and disappointed countenance of his foe, who\\nfell sullenly and disappointed down the irrecoverable precipice.\\n\\n\"To cover! to cover!\" cried Hawkeye, who just then had despatched the\\nenemy; \"to cover, for your lives! the work is but half ended!\"\\n\\nThe young Mohican gave a shout of triumph, and, followed by Duncan, he\\nglided up the acclivity they had descended to the combat, and sought the\\nfriendly shelter of the rocks and shrubs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      \"They linger yet,\\n  Avengers of their native land.\"\\n\\n  GRAY.\\n\\n\\nThe warning call of the scout was not uttered without occasion. During\\nthe occurrence of the deadly encounter just related, the roar of the\\nfalls was unbroken by any human sound whatever. It would seem that\\ninterest in the result had kept the natives on the opposite shores in\\nbreathless suspense, while the quick evolutions and swift changes in the\\nposition of the combatants, effectually prevented a fire that might\\nprove dangerous alike to friend and enemy. But the moment the struggle\\nwas decided, a yell arose as fierce and savage as wild and revengful\\npassions could throw into the air. It was followed by the swift flashes\\nof the rifles, which sent their leaden messengers across the rock in\\nvolleys, as though the assailants would pour out their impotent fury on\\nthe insensible scene of the fatal contest.\\n\\nA steady, though deliberate return was made from the rifle of\\nChingachgook, who had maintained his post throughout the fray with\\nunmoved resolution. When the triumphant shout of Uncas was borne to his\\nears, the gratified father raised his voice in a single responsive cry,\\nafter which his busy piece alone proved that he still guarded his pass\\nwith unwearied diligence. In this manner many minutes flew by with the\\nswiftness of thought: the rifles of the assailants speaking, at times,\\nin rattling volleys, and at others, in occasional, scattering shots.\\nThough the rock, the trees, and the shrubs, were cut and torn in a\\nhundred places around the besieged, their cover was so close, and so\\nrigidly maintained, that, as yet, David had been the only sufferer in\\ntheir little band.\\n\\n\"Let them burn their powder,\" said the deliberate scout, while bullet\\nafter bullet whizzed by the place where he securely lay; \"there will be\\na fine gathering of lead when it is over, and I fancy the imps will tire\\nof the sport, afore these old stones cry out for mercy! Uncas, boy, you\\nwaste the kernels by overcharging: and a kicking rifle never carries a\\ntrue bullet. I told you to take that loping miscreant under the line of\\nwhite paint; now, if your bullet went a hair\\'s breadth, it went two\\ninches above it. The life lies low in a Mingo, and humanity teaches us\\nto make a quick end of the sarpents.\"\\n\\nA quiet smile lighted the haughty features of the young Mohican,\\nbetraying his knowledge of the English language, as well as of the\\nother\\'s meaning; but he suffered it to pass away without vindication or\\nreply.\\n\\n\"I cannot permit you to accuse Uncas of want of judgment or of skill,\"\\nsaid Duncan; \"he saved my life in the coolest and readiest manner, and\\nhe has made a friend who never will require to be reminded of the debt\\nhe owes.\"\\n\\nUncas partly raised his body, and offered his hand to the grasp of\\nHeyward. During this act of friendship, the two young men exchanged\\nlooks of intelligence which caused Duncan to forget the character and\\ncondition of his wild associate. In the meanwhile, Hawkeye, who looked\\non this burst of youthful feeling with a cool but kind regard, made the\\nfollowing reply:--\\n\\n\"Life is an obligation which friends often owe each other in the\\nwilderness. I dare say I may have served Uncas some such turn myself\\nbefore now; and I very well remember that he has stood between me and\\ndeath five different times: three times from the Mingos, once in\\ncrossing Horican, and--\"\\n\\n\"That bullet was better aimed than common!\" exclaimed Duncan,\\ninvoluntarily shrinking from a shot which struck the rock at his side\\nwith a smart rebound.\\n\\nHawkeye laid his hand on the shapeless metal, and shook his head, as he\\nexamined it, saying, \"Falling lead is never flattened! had it come from\\nthe clouds this might have happened!\"\\n\\nBut the rifle of Uncas was deliberately raised towards the heavens,\\ndirecting his companions to a point, where the mystery was immediately\\nexplained. A ragged oak grew on the right bank of the river, nearly\\nopposite to their position, which, seeking the freedom of the open\\nspace, had inclined so far forward, that its upper branches overhung\\nthat arm of the stream which flowed nearest to its own shore. Among the\\ntopmost leaves, which scantily concealed the gnarled and stunted limbs,\\na savage was nestled, partly concealed by the trunk of the tree, and\\npartly exposed, as though looking down upon them to ascertain the effect\\nproduced by his treacherous aim.\\n\\n\"These devils will scale heaven to circumvent us to our ruin,\" said\\nHawkeye; \"keep him in play, boy, until I can bring \\'Killdeer\\' to bear,\\nwhen we will try his metal on each side of the tree at once.\"\\n\\nUncas delayed his fire until the scout uttered the word. The rifles\\nflashed, the leaves and the bark of the oak flew into the air, and were\\nscattered by the wind, but the Indian answered their assault by a\\ntaunting laugh, sending down upon them another bullet in return, that\\nstruck the cap of Hawkeye from his head. Once more the savage yells\\nburst out of the woods, and the leaden hail whistled above the heads of\\nthe besieged, as if to confine them to a place where they might become\\neasy victims to the enterprise of the warrior who had mounted the tree.\\n\\n\"This must be looked to!\" said the scout, glancing about him with an\\nanxious eye. \"Uncas, call up your father; we have need of all our\\nwe\\'pons to bring the cunning varmint from his roost.\"\\n\\nThe signal was instantly given; and, before Hawkeye had reloaded his\\nrifle, they were joined by Chingachgook. When his son pointed out to the\\nexperienced warrior the situation of their dangerous enemy, the usual\\nexclamatory \"Hugh!\" burst from his lips; after which, no further\\nexpression of surprise or alarm was suffered to escape him. Hawkeye and\\nthe Mohicans conversed earnestly together in Delaware for a few moments,\\nwhen each quietly took his post, in order to execute the plan they had\\nspeedily devised.\\n\\nThe warrior in the oak had maintained a quick, though ineffectual fire,\\nfrom the moment of his discovery. But his aim was interrupted by the\\nvigilance of his enemies, whose rifles instantaneously bore on any part\\nof his person that was left exposed. Still his bullets fell in the\\ncentre of the crouching party. The clothes of Heyward, which rendered\\nhim peculiarly conspicuous, were repeatedly cut, and once blood was\\ndrawn from a slight wound in his arm.\\n\\nAt length, emboldened by the long and patient watchfulness of his\\nenemies, the Huron attempted a better and more fatal aim. The quick eye\\nof the Mohicans caught the dark line of his lower limbs incautiously\\nexposed through the thin foliage, a few inches from the trunk of the\\ntree. Their rifles made a common report, when, sinking on his wounded\\nlimb, part of the body of the savage came into view. Swift as thought,\\nHawkeye seized the advantage and discharged his fatal weapon into the\\ntop of the oak. The leaves were unusually agitated; the dangerous rifle\\nfell from its commanding elevation, and after a few moments of vain\\nstruggling, the form of the savage was seen swinging in the wind, while\\nhe still grasped a ragged and naked branch of the tree, with hands\\nclenched in desperation.\\n\\n\"Give him, in pity give him--the contents of another rifle!\" cried\\nDuncan, turning away his eyes in horror from the spectacle of a\\nfellow-creature in such awful jeopardy.\\n\\n\"Not a karnel!\" exclaimed the obdurate Hawkeye; \"his death is certain,\\nand we have no powder to spare, for Indian fights sometimes last for\\ndays; \\'tis their scalps or ours!--and God, who made us, has put into our\\nnatures the craving to keep the skin on the head!\"\\n\\nAgainst this stern and unyielding morality, supported as it was by such\\nvisible policy, there was no appeal. From that moment the yells in the\\nforest once more ceased, the fire was suffered to decline, and all eyes,\\nthose of friends as well as enemies, became fixed on the hopeless\\ncondition of the wretch who was dangling between heaven and earth. The\\nbody yielded to the currents of air, and though no murmur or groan\\nescaped the victim, there were instants when he grimly faced his foes,\\nand the anguish of cold despair might be traced, through the intervening\\ndistance, in possession of his swarthy lineaments. Three several times\\nthe scout raised his piece in mercy, and as often prudence getting the\\nbetter of his intention, it was again silently lowered. At length one\\nhand of the Huron lost its hold, and dropped exhausted to his side. A\\ndesperate and fruitless struggle to recover the branch succeeded, and\\nthen the savage was seen for a fleeting instant, grasping wildly at the\\nempty air. The lightning is not quicker than was the flame from the\\nrifle of Hawkeye; the limbs of the victim trembled and contracted, the\\nhead fell to the bosom, and the body parted the foaming waters like\\nlead, when the element closed above it, in its ceaseless velocity, and\\nevery vestige of the unhappy Huron was lost forever.\\n\\nNo shout of triumph succeeded this important advantage, but even the\\nMohicans gazed at each other in silent horror. A single yell burst from\\nthe woods, and all was again still. Hawkeye, who alone appeared to\\nreason on the occasion, shook his head at his own momentary weakness,\\neven uttering his self-disapprobation aloud.\\n\\n\"\\'Twas the last charge in my horn, and the last bullet in my pouch, and\\n\\'twas the act of a boy!\" he said; \"what mattered it whether he struck\\nthe rock living or dead: feeling would soon be over. Uncas, lad, go down\\nto the canoe, and bring up the big horn; it is all the powder we have\\nleft, and we shall need it to the last grain, or I am ignorant of the\\nMingo nature.\"\\n\\nThe young Mohican complied, leaving the scout turning over the useless\\ncontents of his pouch, and shaking the empty horn with renewed\\ndiscontent. From this unsatisfactory examination, however, he was soon\\ncalled by a loud and piercing exclamation from Uncas, that sounded, even\\nto the unpractised ears of Duncan, as the signal of some new and\\nunexpected calamity. Every thought filled with apprehension for the\\nprecious treasure he had concealed in the cavern, the young man started\\nto his feet, totally regardless of the hazard he incurred by such an\\nexposure. As if actuated by a common impulse, his movement was imitated\\nby his companions, and, together, they rushed down the pass to the\\nfriendly chasm, with a rapidity that rendered the scattering fire of\\ntheir enemies perfectly harmless. The unwonted cry had brought the\\nsisters, together with the wounded David, from their place of refuge;\\nand the whole party, at a single glance, was made acquainted with the\\nnature of the disaster that had disturbed even the practised stoicism of\\ntheir youthful Indian protector.\\n\\nAt a short distance from the rock, their little bark was to be seen\\nfloating across the eddy, towards the swift current of the river, in a\\nmanner which proved that its course was directed by some hidden agent.\\nThe instant this unwelcome sight caught the eye of the scout, his rifle\\nwas levelled as by instinct, but the barrel gave no answer to the bright\\nsparks of the flint.\\n\\n\"\\'Tis too late, \\'tis too late!\" Hawkeye exclaimed, dropping the useless\\npiece in bitter disappointment; \"the miscreant has struck the rapid; and\\nhad we powder, it could hardly send the lead swifter than he now goes!\"\\n\\nThe adventurous Huron raised his head above the shelter of the canoe,\\nand while it glided swiftly down the stream, he waved his hand, and gave\\nforth the shout, which was the known signal of success. His cry was\\nanswered by a yell and a laugh from the woods, as tauntingly exulting as\\nif fifty demons were uttering their blasphemies at the fall of some\\nChristian soul.\\n\\n\"Well may you laugh, ye children of the devil!\" said the scout, seating\\nhimself on a projection of the rock, and suffering his gun to fall\\nneglected at his feet, \"for the three quickest and surest rifles in\\nthese woods are no better than so many stalks of mullein, or the last\\nyear\\'s horns of a buck!\"\\n\\n\"What is to be done?\" demanded Duncan, losing the first feeling of\\ndisappointment in a more manly desire for exertion; \"what will become of\\nus?\"\\n\\nHawkeye made no other reply than by passing his finger around the crown\\nof his head, in a manner so significant, that none who witnessed the\\naction could mistake its meaning.\\n\\n\"Surely, surely, our case is not so desperate!\" exclaimed the youth;\\n\"the Hurons are not here; we may make good the caverns; we may oppose\\ntheir landing.\"\\n\\n\"With what?\" coolly demanded the scout. \"The arrows of Uncas, or such\\ntears as women shed! No, no; you are young, and rich, and have friends,\\nand at such an age I know it is hard to die! But,\" glancing his eyes at\\nthe Mohicans, \"let us remember we are men without a cross, and let us\\nteach these natives of the forest that white blood can run as freely as\\nred, when the appointed hour is come.\"\\n\\nDuncan turned quickly in the direction indicated by the other\\'s eyes,\\nand read a confirmation of his worst apprehensions in the conduct of the\\nIndians. Chingachgook, placing himself in a dignified posture on another\\nfragment of the rock, had already laid aside his knife and tomahawk, and\\nwas in the act of taking the eagle\\'s plume from his head, and smoothing\\nthe solitary tuft of hair in readiness to perform its last and revolting\\noffice. His countenance was composed, though thoughtful, while his dark\\ngleaming eyes were gradually losing the fierceness of the combat in an\\nexpression better suited to the change he expected momentarily to\\nundergo.\\n\\n\"Our case is not, cannot be so hopeless!\" said Duncan; \"even at this\\nmoment succor may be at hand. I see no enemies! they have sickened of a\\nstruggle in which they risk so much with so little prospect of gain!\"\\n\\n\"It may be a minute, or it may be an hour, afore the wily sarpents steal\\nupon us, and it is quite in natur\\' for them to be lying within hearing\\nat this very moment,\" said Hawkeye; \"but come they will, and in such a\\nfashion as will leave us nothing to hope! Chingachgook\"--he spoke in\\nDelaware--\"my brother, we have fought our last battle together, and the\\nMaquas will triumph in the death of the sage man of the Mohicans, and of\\nthe pale-face, whose eyes can make night as day, and level the clouds\\nto the mists of the springs!\"\\n\\n\"Let the Mingo women go weep over their slain!\" returned the Indian,\\nwith characteristic pride and unmoved firmness; \"the Great Snake of the\\nMohicans has coiled himself in their wigwams, and has poisoned their\\ntriumph with the wailings of children whose fathers have not returned!\\nEleven warriors lie hid from the graves of their tribes since the snows\\nhave melted, and none will tell where to find them when the tongue of\\nChingachgook shall be silent! Let them draw the sharpest knife, and\\nwhirl the swiftest tomahawk, for their bitterest enemy is in their\\nhands. Uncas, topmost branch of a noble trunk, call on the cowards to\\nhasten or their hearts will soften, and they will change to women!\"\\n\\n\"They look among the fishes for their dead!\" returned the low, soft\\nvoice of the youthful chieftain; \"the Hurons float with the slimy eels!\\nThey drop from the oaks like fruit that is ready to be eaten! and the\\nDelawares laugh!\"\\n\\n\"Ay, ay,\" muttered the scout, who had listened to this peculiar burst of\\nthe natives with deep attention; \"they have warmed their Indian\\nfeelings, and they\\'ll soon provoke the Maquas to give them a speedy end.\\nAs for me, who am of the whole blood of the whites, it is befitting that\\nI should die as becomes my color, with no words of scoffing in my mouth,\\nand without bitterness at the heart!\"\\n\\n\"Why die at all!\" said Cora, advancing from the place where natural\\nhorror had, until this moment, held her riveted to the rock; \"the path\\nis open on every side; fly, then, to the woods, and call on God for\\nsuccor. Go, brave men, we owe you too much already; let us no longer\\ninvolve you in our hapless fortunes!\"\\n\\n\"You but little know the craft of the Iroquois, lady, if you judge they\\nhave left the path open to the woods!\" returned Hawkeye, who, however,\\nimmediately added in his simplicity, \"the down stream current, it is\\ncertain, might soon sweep us beyond the reach of their rifles or the\\nsounds of their voices.\"\\n\\n\"Then try the river. Why linger to add to the number of the victims of\\nour merciless enemies?\"\\n\\n\"Why,\" repeated the scout, looking about him proudly, \"because it is\\nbetter for a man to die at peace with himself than to live haunted by an\\nevil conscience! What answer could we give Munro, when he asked us where\\nand how we left his children?\"\\n\\n\"Go to him, and say, that you left them with a message to hasten to\\ntheir aid,\" returned Cora, advancing nigher to the scout, in her\\ngenerous ardor; \"that the Hurons bear them into the northern wilds, but\\nthat by vigilance and speed they may yet be rescued; and if, after all,\\nit should please heaven that his assistance come too late, bear to him,\"\\nshe continued, her voice gradually lowering, until it seemed nearly\\nchoked, \"the love, the blessings, the final prayers of his daughters,\\nand bid him not mourn their early fate, but to look forward with humble\\nconfidence to the Christian\\'s goal to meet his children.\"\\n\\nThe hard, weather-beaten features of the scout began to work, and when\\nshe had ended, he dropped his chin to his hand, like a man musing\\nprofoundly on the nature of the proposal.\\n\\n\"There is reason in her words!\" at length broke from his compressed and\\ntrembling lips; \"ay, and they bear the spirit of Christianity; what\\nmight be right and proper in a redskin, may be sinful in a man who has\\nnot even a cross in blood to plead for his ignorance. Chingachgook!\\nUncas! hear you the talk of the dark-eyed woman!\"\\n\\nHe now spoke in Delaware to his companions, and his address, though calm\\nand deliberate, seemed very decided. The elder Mohican heard him with\\ndeep gravity, and appeared to ponder on his words, as though he felt the\\nimportance of their import. After a moment of hesitation, he waved his\\nhand in assent, and uttered the English word \"Good!\" with the peculiar\\nemphasis of his people. Then, replacing his knife and tomahawk in his\\ngirdle, the warrior moved silently to the edge of the rock which was\\nmost concealed from the banks of the river. Here he paused a moment,\\npointed significantly to the woods below, and saying a few words in his\\nown language, as if indicating his intended route, he dropped into the\\nwater, and sank from before the eyes of the witnesses of his movements.\\n\\nThe scout delayed his departure to speak to the generous girl, whose\\nbreathing became lighter as she saw the success of her remonstrance.\\n\\n\"Wisdom is sometimes given to the young, as well as to the old,\" he\\nsaid; \"and what you have spoken is wise, not to call it by a better\\nword. If you are led into the woods, that is such of you as may be\\nspared for a while, break the twigs on the bushes as you pass, and make\\nthe marks of your trail as broad as you can, when, if mortal eyes can\\nsee them, depend on having a friend who will follow to the ends of \\'arth\\nafore he desarts you.\"\\n\\nHe gave Cora an affectionate shake of the hand, lifted his rifle, and\\nafter regarding it a moment with melancholy solicitude, laid it\\ncarefully aside, and descended to the place where Chingachgook had just\\ndisappeared. For an instant he hung suspended by the rock; and looking\\nabout him, with a countenance of peculiar care, he added, bitterly, \"Had\\nthe powder held out, this disgrace could never have befallen!\" then,\\nloosening his hold, the water closed above his head, and he also became\\nlost to view.\\n\\nAll eyes were now turned on Uncas, who stood leaning against the ragged\\nrock, in immovable composure. After waiting a short time, Cora pointed\\ndown the river, and said:--\\n\\n\"Your friends have not been seen, and are now, most probably, in safety;\\nis it not time for you to follow?\"\\n\\n\"Uncas will stay,\" the young Mohican calmly answered in English.\\n\\n\"To increase the horror of our capture, and to diminish the chances of\\nour release! Go, generous young man,\" Cora continued, lowering her eyes\\nunder the gaze of the Mohican, and, perhaps, with an intuitive\\nconsciousness of her power; \"go to my father, as I have said, and be the\\nmost confidential of my messengers. Tell him to trust you with the means\\nto buy the freedom of his daughters. Go! \\'tis my wish, \\'tis my prayer,\\nthat you will go!\"\\n\\nThe settled, calm look of the young chief changed to an expression of\\ngloom, but he no longer hesitated. With a noiseless step he crossed the\\nrock, and dropped into the troubled stream. Hardly a breath was drawn by\\nthose he left behind, until they caught a glimpse of his head emerging\\nfor air, far down the current, when he again sank, and was seen no more.\\n\\nThese sudden and apparently successful experiments had all taken place\\nin a few minutes of that time which had now become so precious. After\\nthe last look at Uncas, Cora turned, and, with a quivering lip,\\naddressed herself to Heyward:--\\n\\n\"I have heard of your boasted skill in the water, too, Duncan,\" she\\nsaid; \"follow, then, the wise example set you by these simple and\\nfaithful beings.\"\\n\\n\"Is such the faith that Cora Munro would exact from her protector?\" said\\nthe young man, smiling mournfully, but with bitterness.\\n\\n\"This is not a time for idle subtleties and false opinions,\" she\\nanswered; \"but a moment when every duty should be equally considered.\\nTo us you can be of no further service here, but your precious life may\\nbe saved for other and nearer friends.\"\\n\\nHe made no reply, though his eyes fell wistfully on the beautiful form\\nof Alice, who was clinging to his arm with the dependency of an infant.\\n\\n\"Consider,\" continued Cora, after a pause, during which she seemed to\\nstruggle with a pang even more acute than any that her fears had\\nexcited, \"that the worst to us can be but death; a tribute that all must\\npay at the good time of God\\'s appointment.\"\\n\\n\"There are evils worse than death,\" said Duncan, speaking hoarsely, and\\nas if fretful at her importunity, \"but which the presence of one who\\nwould die in your behalf may avert.\"\\n\\nCora ceased her entreaties; and, veiling her face in her shawl, drew the\\nnearly insensible Alice after her into the deepest recess of the inner\\ncavern.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "   'summary_text': 'Feeling that the cry is some kind of warning, whether intended or not, Hawkeye leads the entire party from the caves. As Heyward remarks upon the loveliness of the scene, the horrifying sound comes again as if from the bed of the river, and Heyward now recognizes it as the shriek of a horse in terror. The scout\\'s reckoning that the horses are frightened by hovering wolves is immediately confirmed by a long howl that swiftly recedes into the depths of the forest, an abandonment that indicates enemy Indians are near. Once again secure in his knowledge of things, Hawkeye directs everyone to hide in moon shadows where they have a full view of both shores. Hours pass, and all fall asleep except the ever watchful scout and the Mohicans. The moon sets, and as pale dawn begins, the Iroquois attack with hellish yells and rifle reports. Gamut exposes himself, is wounded, and falls unconscious, while Hawkeye slips below and shoots one enemy, afterwards saying that their only hope is to hold the rock until Munro sends a party to help them. Heyward takes the girls into the outer cave where the reviving Gamut has been taken. As Cora reminds him how much his safety means to them, the major glances at Alice, reassures them, and rejoins the others outside. He and the scout deploy themselves in a little thicket of pines below the rock that splits the falls. Dawn comes. Then a long, anxious, and quiet watch succeeds until Hawkeye detects that four Indians have swum dangerously down to the rock above the defenders. As they wait, a fifth one, struggling to reach the rock, is thrown into the air and over the falls with a single, despairing shriek. After whistling Uncas to them, Hawkeye and the warrior shoot two Indians as the four charge them. When Heyward\\'s pistols misfire, he and the scout grapple hand-to-hand with the two remaining enemies until Hawkeye dispatches his foe with a knife. Heyward is about to be dragged over the precipice with the other when Uncas severs the tendons of the Iroquois\\' wrist and grabs Heyward as the wounded savage falls to his destruction. As the survivors take cover, the Indians on shore yell and fire, and a give-and-take battle begins. One Iroquois, who has climbed an oak tree near shore, fires down upon the protagonists and slightly wounds Heyward. Setting up a crossfire with Chingachgook, Hawkeye fires his rifle \"Killdeer\" and wounds the savage, who is left swinging in the wind with a desperate grasp on a branch. To save powder, the scout refuses to show mercy and finish the kill, but he weakens and discharges his last powder and bullet as the man falls toward the rocks and water. Uncas goes for munitions in the canoe only to find an Indian swimming away with it. Now essentially bereft of defensive means, the Mohicans scoff at their enemies and prepare for death. Hawkeye is quietly and stoically preparing himself also when Cora, who has been brave all along, entreats the men to escape downstream and effect a rescue. Convinced of her reason, Chingachgook slips under the water and away. After telling her to leave a marked trail if they are captured, Hawkeye carefully lays \"Killdeer\" aside and disappears into the water. Uncas remains until Cora, lowering her eyes, asks him to go to her father as her \"most confidential\" messenger; then he also drops into the water. When Heyward refuses to leave on the grounds that his presence may keep the girls from evils worse than death, Cora draws \"the nearly insensible Alice after her into the deepest recess of the inner cavern.\"',\n",
       "   'summary_analysis': 'While outwardly these two chapters are concerned chiefly with fright and action for entertaining the reader and multiplying difficulties for the characters, it also portrays the bloody cross-purposes of frontier strife: seven Iroquois are killed and two white men are wounded, while the male protagonists are finally confronted with a moral dilemma. Are they to face danger and probable death with calm, frontal bravery, or are they to turn to subterfuge and escape, hoping to effect a rescue but running the risk of being deserters? It is a bigger problem than that found in most sentimental novels, where woman\\'s greatest threat is usually to her virtue or reputation. Here it involves the age-old physical responsibility of the male for the female and -- greater yet -- of the strong for the weak, the typical assumption in the myth of the American frontiersman. The decision and resultant escape of Hawkeye, whose Christian reasoning is notably different from that of the Mohicans, is of a piece with the American self-ideal about necessity and the ingenuity of \"finding a way out.\" The fortitude of Cora at this point is also consistent with the accredited strength of American pioneer womanhood; it is she who sees beyond the immediate grave situation to a possible desperate solution for which she femininely entreats rather than insists. Further, though Cooper\\'s females only seldom do so, in this instance Cora takes on the three-dimensional qualities of a real woman character when, revealing a bit of her personal feelings and utilizing Uncas\\', she urges the subtle distinction about messengers which leads the young Mohican to escape also. At his best, Cooper is not a novelist who presses his thematic elements very hard upon his reader. But the preceding elements are in these two chapters, and so are others such as the rifle lore that Hawkeye voices during the battles. The two white men from Fort Edward are significantly wounded in this raw frontier condition that is new to them. Although as yet unaware of it, Gamut is already confronting what Hawkeye knows and, after the psalmodist is unconscious, voices: that \"singing won\\'t do any good with the Iroquois.\" Thus in the singing master, religious idealism and reality are meeting head-on. Also, Cooper is very slowly and carefully developing the attraction between Uncas and Cora. The surplus sentimental heroine is gradually being paired with a hero, but it is an original pairing that involves the conservative idea of racial \"place\" and is to result in tragic complications. While the story moves along at a brisk pace with action and Indian customs such as the preparation for dying, Cooper is touching upon and getting ready to develop further more crucial aspects of the frontier situation in the New World.',\n",

Nonetheless, they all hide in the cave, Gamut still addled and Alice trembling and weeping against Cora\\'s breast. The major closes the inner entrance with the blanket and a pile of sassafras, then seats himself with a pistol clenched convulsively in his hand. Gamut sings \\\\\"Isle of Wight,\\\\\" which is interrupted by savage yells from the center of the island as a rush of voices pours down the island. When a triumphant cry is followed by the shout, \\\\\"La Longue Carabine!\\\\\" Heyward for the first time realizes that his late companion was the celebrated hunter and scout of the English camp, and he feels certain that their friends have escaped. As the Indians enter the neighboring cavern, the major peers out of his sassafras entrance, sees the gigantic chief, and watches as exultant warriors bring blood-stained brush from the other cave and unwittingly pile it against his entrance. Though the Indians\\' shouts indicate anger in seeing their own dead and disappointment at finding no prisoners or dead enemies, Heyward feels that perhaps now they are safe. However, just as Alice begins to offer thanks, the features of Le Renard Subtil appear at the other entrance and the major fires his pistol without success. There is only a moment of surprise before a clamorous rush captures the four whites, who are dragged outside and surrounded by the triumphant Hurons.\", \"analysis\": \"With the woodsmen off the scene of action, this chapter presents the relative ineffectiveness of the \\\\\"outsiders.\\\\\" As before, Alice is the sentimental heroine, trembling and ready to swoon so that she demands the attention of others. Gamut is still too much under the influence of his wound to learn anything from his situation yet; he mechanically follows his interest in song. It is notable that while Cooper continues to present him as a weak personage -- a weakness consistent with his naivete as a comic Yankee character -- he again credits the psalmodist with a singing voice so good that it can cast a spell even through a travesty of song. Heyward, still solicitous of the girls and especially of Alice, is seen as the determined but unsuccessful hero who is too much out of his element. Little is seen of Cora in the present action, but she remains a strong character in contrast to Alice. By the end of this chapter, the first segment of the plot pattern that Cooper works so well is completed: the pursuit, which was instigated earlier, has now reached the point of capture. What the reader can expect now are the possibility and difficulty of escape. Actually Cooper has already varied his pattern by letting three of the party escape before the capture. Plot thus adds hopeful suspense to the brutal threat of the obviously savage captors, made more threatening by the presence of the subtle Magua.\"}',\n",

While all the images\\nand events he had witnessed remained deeply impressed on his memory, he\\nfelt a difficulty in persuading himself of their truth. Still ignorant\\nof the fate of those who had trusted to the aid of the swift current, he\\nat first listened intently to any signal, or sounds of alarm, which\\nmight announce the good or evil fortune of their hazardous undertaking.\\nHis attention was, however, bestowed in vain; for, with the\\ndisappearance of Uncas, every sign of the adventurers had been lost,\\nleaving him in total uncertainty of their fate.\\n\\nIn a moment of such painful doubt, Duncan did not hesitate to look about\\nhim, without consulting that protection from the rocks which just before\\nhad been so necessary to his safety. Every effort, however, to detect\\nthe least evidence of the approach of their hidden enemies, was as\\nfruitless as the inquiry after his late companions. The wooded banks of\\nthe rivers seemed again deserted by everything possessing animal life.\\nThe uproar which had so lately echoed through the vaults of the forest\\nwas gone, leaving the rush of the waters to swell and sink on the\\ncurrents of the air, in the unmingled sweetness of nature. A fish-hawk,\\nwhich, secure on the topmost branches of a dead pine, had been a distant\\nspectator of the fray, now stooped from his high and ragged perch, and\\nsoared, in wide sweeps, above his prey; while a jay, whose noisy voice\\nhad been stilled by the hoarser cries of the savages, ventured again to\\nopen his discordant throat, as though once more in undisturbed\\npossession of his wild domains. Duncan caught from these natural\\naccompaniments of the solitary scene a glimmering of hope; and he began\\nto rally his faculties to renewed exertions, with something like a\\nreviving confidence of success.\\n\\n\"The Hurons are not to be seen,\" he said, addressing David, who had by\\nno means recovered from the effects of the stunning blow he had\\nreceived; \"let us conceal ourselves in the cavern, and trust the rest to\\nProvidence.\"\\n\\n\"I remember to have united with two comely maidens, in lifting up our\\nvoices in praise and thanksgiving,\" returned the bewildered\\nsinging-master; \"since which time I have been visited by a heavy\\njudgment for my sins. I have been mocked with the likeness of sleep,\\nwhile sounds of discord have rent my ears, such as might manifest the\\nfulness of time, and that nature had forgotten her harmony.\"\\n\\n\"Poor fellow! thine own period was, in truth, near its accomplishment!\\nBut arouse, and come with me; I will lead you where all other sounds but\\nthose of your own psalmody shall be excluded.\"\\n\\n\"There is melody in the fall of the cataract, and the rushing of many\\nwaters is sweet to the senses!\" said David, pressing his hand confusedly\\non his brow. \"Is not the air yet filled with shrieks and cries, as\\nthough the departed spirits of the damned--\"\\n\\n\"Not now, not now,\" interrupted the impatient Heyward, \"they have\\nceased, and they who raised them, I trust in God, they are gone too!\\neverything but the water is still and at peace; in, then, where you may\\ncreate those sounds you love so well to hear.\"\\n\\nDavid smiled sadly, though not without a momentary gleam of pleasure, at\\nthis allusion to his beloved vocation. He no longer hesitated to be led\\nto a spot which promised such unalloyed gratification to his wearied\\nsenses; and, leaning on the arm of his companion, he entered the narrow\\nmouth of the cave. Duncan seized a pile of the sassafras, which he drew\\nbefore the passage, studiously concealing every appearance of an\\naperture. Within this fragile barrier he arranged the blankets abandoned\\nby the foresters, darkening the inner extremity of the cavern, while its\\nouter received a chastened light from the narrow ravine, through which\\none arm of the river rushed, to form the junction with its sister\\nbranch, a few rods below.\\n\\n\"I like not that principle of the natives, which teaches them to submit\\nwithout a struggle, in emergencies that appear desperate,\" he said,\\nwhile busied in this employment; \"our own maxim, which says, \\'while life\\nremains there is hope,\\' is more consoling, and better suited to a\\nsoldier\\'s temperament. To you, Cora, I will urge no words of idle\\nencouragement; your own fortitude and undisturbed reason will teach you\\nall that may become your sex; but cannot we dry the tears of that\\ntrembling weeper on your bosom?\"\\n\\n\"I am calmer, Duncan,\" said Alice, raising herself from the arms of her\\nsister, and forcing an appearance of composure through her tears; \"much\\ncalmer, now. Surely, in this hidden spot we are safe, we are secret,\\nfree from injury; we will hope everything from those generous men who\\nhave risked so much already in our behalf.\"\\n\\n\"Now does our gentle Alice speak like a daughter of Munro!\" said\\nHeyward, pausing to press her hand as he passed towards the outer\\nentrance of the cavern. \"With two such examples of courage before him, a\\nman would be ashamed to prove other than a hero.\" He then seated himself\\nin the centre of the cavern, grasping his remaining pistol with a hand\\nconvulsively clenched, while his contracted and frowning eye announced\\nthe sullen desperation of his purpose. \"The Hurons, if they come, may\\nnot gain our position so easily as they think,\" he lowly muttered; and\\ndropping his head back against the rock, he seemed to await the result\\nin patience, though his gaze was unceasingly bent on the open avenue to\\ntheir place of retreat.\\n\\nWith the last sound of his voice, a deep, a long, and almost breathless\\nsilence succeeded. The fresh air of the morning had penetrated the\\nrecess, and its influence was gradually felt on the spirits of its\\ninmates. As minute after minute passed by, leaving them in undisturbed\\nsecurity, the insinuating feeling of hope was gradually gaining\\npossession of every bosom, though each one felt reluctant to give\\nutterance to expectations that the next moment might so fearfully\\ndestroy.\\n\\nDavid alone formed an exception to these varying emotions. A gleam of\\nlight from the opening crossed his wan countenance, and fell upon the\\npages of the little volume, whose leaves he was again occupied in\\nturning, as if searching for some song more fitted to their condition\\nthan any that had yet met his eye. He was, most probably, acting all\\nthis time under a confused recollection of the promised consolation of\\nDuncan. At length, it would seem, his patient industry found its reward;\\nfor, without explanation or apology, he pronounced aloud the words \"Isle\\nof Wight,\" drew a long, sweet sound from his pitch-pipe, and then ran\\nthrough the preliminary modulations of the air, whose name he had just\\nmentioned with the sweeter tones of his own musical voice.\\n\\n\"May not this prove dangerous?\" asked Cora, glancing her dark eye at\\nMajor Heyward.\\n\\n\"Poor fellow! his voice is too feeble to be heard amid the din of the\\nfalls,\" was the answer; \"besides, the cavern will prove his friend. Let\\nhim indulge his passion, since it may be done without hazard.\"\\n\\n\"Isle of Wight!\" repeated David, looking about him with that dignity\\nwith which he had long been wont to silence the whispering echoes of his\\nschool; \"\\'tis a brave tune, and set to solemn words; let it be sung with\\nmeet respect!\"\\n\\nAfter allowing a moment of stillness, to enforce his discipline, the\\nvoice of the singer was heard, in low, murmuring syllables, gradually\\nstealing on the ear, until it filled the narrow vault with sounds\\nrendered trebly thrilling by the feeble and tremulous utterance produced\\nby his debility. The melody, which no weakness could destroy, gradually\\nwrought its sweet influence on the senses of those who heard it. It even\\nprevailed over the miserable travesty of the song of David which the\\nsinger had selected from a volume of similar effusions, and caused the\\nsense to be forgotten in the insinuating harmony of the sounds. Alice\\nunconsciously dried her tears, and bent her melting eyes on the pallid\\nfeatures of Gamut with an expression of chastened delight that she\\nneither affected nor wished to conceal. Cora bestowed an approving smile\\non the pious efforts of the namesake of the Jewish prince, and Heyward\\nsoon turned his steady, stern look from the outlet of the cavern, to\\nfasten it, with a milder character, on the face of David, or to meet the\\nwandering beams which at moments strayed from the humid eyes of Alice.\\nThe open sympathy of the listeners stirred the spirit of the votary of\\nmusic, whose voice regained its richness and volume, without losing that\\ntouching softness which proved its secret charm. Exerting his renovated\\npowers to their utmost, he was yet filling the arches of the cave with\\nlong and full tones, when a yell burst into the air without, that\\ninstantly stilled his pious strains, choking his voice suddenly, as\\nthough his heart had literally bounded into the passage of his throat.\\n\\n\"We are lost!\" exclaimed Alice, throwing herself into the arms of Cora.\\n\\n\"Not yet, not yet,\" returned the agitated but undaunted Heyward; \"the\\nsound came from the centre of the island, and it has been produced by\\nthe sight of their dead companions. We are not yet discovered, and there\\nis still hope.\"\\n\\nFaint and almost despairing as was the prospect of escape, the words of\\nDuncan were not thrown away, for it awakened the powers of the sisters\\nin such a manner that they awaited the result in silence. A second yell\\nsoon followed the first, when a rush of voices was heard pouring down\\nthe island, from its upper to its lower extremity, until they reached\\nthe naked rock above the caverns, where, after a shout of savage\\ntriumph, the air continued full of horrible cries and screams, such as\\nman alone can utter, and he only when in a state of the fiercest\\nbarbarity.\\n\\nThe sounds quickly spread around them in every direction. Some called to\\ntheir fellows from the water\\'s edge, and were answered from the heights\\nabove. Cries were heard in the startling vicinity of the chasm between\\nthe two caves, which mingled with hoarser yells that arose out of the\\nabyss of the deep ravine. In short, so rapidly had the savage sounds\\ndiffused themselves over the barren rock, that it was not difficult for\\nthe anxious listeners to imagine they could be heard beneath, as in\\ntruth they were above and on every side of them.\\n\\nIn the midst of this tumult, a triumphant yell was raised within a few\\nyards of the hidden entrance to the cave. Heyward abandoned every hope,\\nwith the belief it was the signal that they were discovered. Again the\\nimpression passed away, as he heard the voices collect near the spot\\nwhere the white man had so reluctantly abandoned his rifle. Amid the\\njargon of the Indian dialects that he now plainly heard, it was easy to\\ndistinguish not only words, but sentences, in the _patois_ of the\\nCanadas. A burst of voices had shouted simultaneously, \"La Longue\\nCarabine!\" causing the opposite woods to re-echo with a name which,\\nHeyward well remembered, had been given by his enemies to a celebrated\\nhunter and scout of the English camp, and who, he now learnt for the\\nfirst time, had been his late companion.\\n\\n\"La Longue Carabine! La Longue Carabine!\" passed from mouth to mouth,\\nuntil the whole band appeared to be collected around a trophy which\\nwould seem to announce the death of its formidable owner. After a\\nvociferous consultation, which was, at times, deafened by bursts of\\nsavage joy, they again separated, filling the air with the name of a\\nfoe, whose body, Heyward could collect from their expressions, they\\nhoped to find concealed in some crevice of the island.\\n\\n\"Now,\" he whispered to the trembling sisters, \"now is the moment of\\nuncertainty! if our place of retreat escape this scrutiny, we are still\\nsafe! In every event, we are assured, by what has fallen from our\\nenemies, that our friends have escaped, and in two short hours we may\\nlook for succor from Webb.\"\\n\\nThere were now a few minutes of fearful stillness, during which Heyward\\nwell knew that the savages conducted their search with greater vigilance\\nand method. More than once he could distinguish their footsteps, as they\\nbrushed the sassafras, causing the faded leaves to rustle, and the\\nbranches to snap. At length, the pile yielded a little, a corner of the\\nblanket fell, and a faint ray of light gleamed into the inner part of\\nthe cave. Cora folded Alice to her bosom in agony, and Duncan sprang to\\nhis feet. A shout was at that moment heard, as if issuing from the\\ncentre of the rock, announcing that the neighboring cavern had at length\\nbeen entered. In a minute, the number and loudness of the voices\\nindicated that the whole party was collected in and around that secret\\nplace.\\n\\nAs the inner passages to the two caves were so close to each other,\\nDuncan, believing that escape was no longer possible, passed David and\\nthe sisters, to place himself between the latter and the first onset of\\nthe terrible meeting. Grown desperate by his situation, he drew nigh the\\nslight barrier which separated him only by a few feet from his\\nrelentless pursuers, and placing his face to the casual opening, he even\\nlooked out, with a sort of desperate indifference, on their movements.\\n\\nWithin reach of his arm was the brawny shoulder of a gigantic Indian,\\nwhose deep and authoritative voice appeared to give directions to the\\nproceedings of his fellows. Beyond him again, Duncan could look into the\\nvault opposite, which was filled with savages, upturning and rifling the\\nhumble furniture of the scout. The wound of David had dyed the leaves of\\nsassafras with a color that the natives well knew was anticipating the\\nseason. Over this sign of their success, they set up a howl, like an\\nopening from so many hounds who had recovered a lost trail. After this\\nyell of victory, they tore up the fragrant bed of the cavern, and bore\\nthe branches into the chasm, scattering the boughs, as if they suspected\\nthem of concealing the person of the man they had so long hated and\\nfeared. One fierce and wild-looking warrior approached the chief\\nbearing a load of the brush, and pointing, exultingly, to the deep red\\nstains with which it was sprinkled, uttered his joy in Indian yells,\\nwhose meaning Heyward was only enabled to comprehend by the frequent\\nrepetition of the name of \"La Longue Carabine!\" When his triumph had\\nceased, he cast the brush on the slight heap that Duncan had made before\\nthe entrance of the second cavern, and closed the view. His example was\\nfollowed by others, who, as they drew the branches from the cave of the\\nscout, threw them into one pile, adding, unconsciously, to the security\\nof those they sought. The very slightness of the defence was its chief\\nmerit, for no one thought of disturbing a mass of brush, which all of\\nthem believed, in that moment of hurry and confusion, had been\\naccidentally raised by the hands of their own party.\\n\\nAs the blankets yielded before the outward pressure, and the branches\\nsettled in the fissure of the rock by their own weight, forming a\\ncompact body, Duncan once more breathed freely. With a light step, and\\nlighter heart, he returned to the centre of the cave, and took the place\\nhe had left, where he could command a view of the opening next the\\nriver. While he was in the act of making this movement, the Indians, as\\nif changing their purpose by a common impulse, broke away from the\\ncavern in a body, and were heard rushing up the island again, towards\\nthe point whence they had originally descended. Here another wailing cry\\nbetrayed that they were again collected around the bodies of their dead\\ncomrades.\\n\\nDuncan now ventured to look at his companions; for, during the most\\ncritical moments of their danger, he had been apprehensive that the\\nanxiety of his countenance might communicate some additional alarm to\\nthose who were so little able to sustain it.\\n\\n\"They are gone, Cora!\" he whispered; \"Alice, they are returned whence\\nthey came, and we are saved! To Heaven, that has alone delivered us from\\nthe grasp of so merciless an enemy, be all the praise!\"\\n\\n\"Then to Heaven will I return my thanks!\" exclaimed the younger sister,\\nrising from the encircling arms of Cora, and casting herself with\\nenthusiastic gratitude on the naked rock; \"to that Heaven who has spared\\nthe tears of a gray-headed father; has saved the lives of those I so\\nmuch love--\"\\n\\nBoth Heyward, and the more tempered Cora, witnessed the act of\\ninvoluntary emotion with powerful sympathy, the former secretly\\nbelieving that piety had never worn a form so lovely as it had now\\nassumed in the youthful person of Alice. Her eyes radiant with the glow\\nof grateful feelings; the flush of her beauty was again seated on her\\ncheeks, and her whole soul seemed ready and anxious to pour out its\\nthanksgivings, through the medium of her eloquent features. But when her\\nlips moved, the words they should have uttered appeared frozen by some\\nnew and sudden chill. Her bloom gave place to the paleness of death; her\\nsoft and melting eyes grew hard, and seemed contracting with horror;\\nwhile those hands which she had raised, clasped in each other, towards\\nheaven, dropped in horizontal lines before her, the fingers pointed\\nforward in convulsed motion. Heyward turned, the instant she gave a\\ndirection to his suspicions, and, peering just above the ledge which\\nformed the threshold of the open outlet of the cavern, he beheld the\\nmalignant, fierce, and savage features of Le Renard Subtil.\\n\\nIn that moment of surprise, the self-possession of Heyward did not\\ndesert him. He observed by the vacant expression of the Indian\\'s\\ncountenance, that his eye, accustomed to the open air, had not yet been\\nable to penetrate the dusky light which pervaded the depth of the\\ncavern. He had even thought of retreating beyond a curvature in the\\nnatural wall, which might still conceal him and his companions, when, by\\nthe sudden gleam of intelligence that shot across the features of the\\nsavage, he saw it was too late, and that they were betrayed.\\n\\nThe look of exultation and brutal triumph which announced this terrible\\ntruth was irresistibly irritating. Forgetful of everything but the\\nimpulses of his hot blood, Duncan levelled his pistol and fired. The\\nreport of the weapon made the cavern bellow like an eruption from a\\nvolcano; and when the smoke it vomited had been driven away before the\\ncurrent of air which issued from the ravine, the place so lately\\noccupied by the features of his treacherous guide was vacant. Rushing to\\nthe outlet, Heyward caught a glimpse of his dark figure, stealing around\\na low and narrow ledge, which soon hid him entirely from sight.\\n\\nAmong the savages, a frightful stillness succeeded the explosion, which\\nhad just been heard bursting from the bowels of the rock. But when Le\\nRenard raised his voice in a long and intelligible whoop, it was\\nanswered by a spontaneous yell from the mouth of every Indian within\\nhearing of the sound. The clamorous noises again rushed down the\\nisland; and before Duncan had time to recover from the shock, his feeble\\nbarrier of brush was scattered to the winds, the cavern was entered at\\nboth its extremities, and he and his companions were dragged from their\\nshelter and borne into the day, where they stood surrounded by the whole\\nband of the triumphant Hurons.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "   'summary_text': 'In the stillness that follows, Heyward finds it hard to believe what has happened, especially as nature seems to reassert itself with the song of birds. Nonetheless, they all hide in the cave, Gamut still addled and Alice trembling and weeping against Cora\\'s breast. The major closes the inner entrance with the blanket and a pile of sassafras, then seats himself with a pistol clenched convulsively in his hand. Gamut sings \"Isle of Wight,\" which is interrupted by savage yells from the center of the island as a rush of voices pours down the island. When a triumphant cry is followed by the shout, \"La Longue Carabine!\" Heyward for the first time realizes that his late companion was the celebrated hunter and scout of the English camp, and he feels certain that their friends have escaped. As the Indians enter the neighboring cavern, the major peers out of his sassafras entrance, sees the gigantic chief, and watches as exultant warriors bring blood-stained brush from the other cave and unwittingly pile it against his entrance. Though the Indians\\' shouts indicate anger in seeing their own dead and disappointment at finding no prisoners or dead enemies, Heyward feels that perhaps now they are safe. However, just as Alice begins to offer thanks, the features of Le Renard Subtil appear at the other entrance and the major fires his pistol without success. There is only a moment of surprise before a clamorous rush captures the four whites, who are dragged outside and surrounded by the triumphant Hurons.',\n",
       "   'summary_analysis': 'With the woodsmen off the scene of action, this chapter presents the relative ineffectiveness of the \"outsiders.\" As before, Alice is the sentimental heroine, trembling and ready to swoon so that she demands the attention of others. Gamut is still too much under the influence of his wound to learn anything from his situation yet; he mechanically follows his interest in song. It is notable that while Cooper continues to present him as a weak personage -- a weakness consistent with his naivete as a comic Yankee character -- he again credits the psalmodist with a singing voice so good that it can cast a spell even through a travesty of song. Heyward, still solicitous of the girls and especially of Alice, is seen as the determined but unsuccessful hero who is too much out of his element. Little is seen of Cora in the present action, but she remains a strong character in contrast to Alice. By the end of this chapter, the first segment of the plot pattern that Cooper works so well is completed: the pursuit, which was instigated earlier, has now reached the point of capture. What the reader can expect now are the possibility and difficulty of escape. Actually Cooper has already varied his pattern by letting three of the party escape before the capture. Plot thus adds hopeful suspense to the brutal threat of the obviously savage captors, made more threatening by the presence of the subtle Magua.',\n",

When he finally convinces them that the three woodsmen have escaped, they are furious, and one savage grabs Alice by the hair in a mock scalping. Before real violence can occur, the chief calls a brief council and the entire party crosses to the south bank of the river where the horses are. Mounted on Heyward\\'s charger, the chief leads most of his people away across river, leaving the prisoners in charge of six Indians headed by Magua. The major tries to secure Magua\\'s help by privately implying that he and the redskin have been in collusion to fool the Hurons all along and by offering rewards. Although Heyward adopts the sententious speech of the Indians, Magua is noncommittal as the group heads south, the sisters mounted and the others afoot. Flanked by the Indians, Cora finds it difficult to leave signs on the trail; once when she drops a glove, she is detected and severely warned by one of their conductors. Never speaking, Magua steadily leads the way through the forests and hills until they finally reach a steep, pyramidal hill with a level summit and few trees -- a perfect place for defense and for avoiding surprise. While the warriors eat the raw meat of a fawn, Heyward again engages Magua in talk. Heyward\\'s expression of Munro\\'s love for his daughters brings a gleam of malignant joy to the Indian\\'s face, and the latter insists upon a private talk with Cora. He proudly tells her that he was born a chief but that, after the Canadians taught him to drink firewater, he was driven from his tribe. Once when working for Munro, he came into Munro\\'s cabin drunk and the latter had him tied up and whipped like a dog before the soldiers. He demands, is it \\\\\"justice to make evil, and then punish for it?\\\\\" Wanting injury for injury, he says he will let Alice go if Cora will come with him as his wife: \\\\\"The body of the gray-head would sleep among his cannon, but his heart would lie within reach of the knife of Le Subtil.\\\\\" Cora is indignant and returns to her fellow captives. Magua goes to the lolling savages and begins a skillful harangue, building their emotions to the point of rage and vengeance. As they rush upon their prisoners with drawn knives and uplifted tomahawks, Magua villainously invites them to prolong the victims\\' misery. Heyward and Gamut struggle to no avail, and all four are tied to saplings while splinters and fire are prepared for the torture. Magua again makes his proposal, and Cora leaves the decision to Alice, who hesitates in her weakness but finally says no. Gnashing his teeth, the Huron hurls his tomahawk just above Alice\\'s head, cutting some of her ringlets. Maddened, Heyward snaps his bonds and rushes upon another Indian who is about to throw his weapon. In the struggle, Heyward goes down and the Indian raises his knife fatally. But the crack of a rifle is heard, and the Indian\\'s look changes to vacant wildness as he falls dead on the faded leaves beside Heyward.\", \"analysis\": \"These chapters are important for certain revelations and one presentation of status quo ante . The latter comes in Magua\\'s explaining his past; his noble birth and his deserved but ignoble treatment by Munro do not justify his present actions, but they do make him and his conduct believable. They also raise the questions of justice and the big context of shared responsibility. The revelations begin with Heyward\\'s learning of the fame of his two former Indian companions, Chingachgook as \\\\\"Le Gros Serpent\\\\\"  and Uncas as \\\\\"Le Cerf Agile\\\\\" . Magua makes clear not only his motives but also the alternative routes that he will let his vengeance take. Perhaps the most important is Gamut\\'s self-revelation when he struggles hand-to-hand with his captors: \\\\\"David had contended, and the novelty of the circumstance held him silent.\\\\\" The realities of frontier strife are beginning to impinge upon him. Two influences on Cooper\\'s fiction are also apparent. Indian lore comes forth in the figurative language of the natives, in the masterful and persuasive oratory of Magua, in the Hurons\\' contrasting silent patience and loud bloodthirstiness, and in methods of torture such as tying a man\\'s arms to the tops of two bent saplings that will recoil in different directions. Sentimental qualities appear in the reactions of the fragile Alice, in the extreme testing of Cora\\'s virtue and familial emotions, and in Heyward\\'s over-vocalized sense of duty and honor. Holding together all of these fictional elements is the plot device of the chase, through which a reversal of fortunes has occurred. Some of the pursued and some of the pursuers have exchanged their roles, while some have had relative security usurped by imminent danger and vice versa.\"}',\n",
       "   'chapter': '\\n  \"I fear we shall outsleep the coming morn\\n  As much as we this night have overwatched!\"\\n\\n  _Midsummer Night\\'s Dream._\\n\\n\\nThe instant the shock of this sudden misfortune had abated, Duncan began\\nto make his observations on the appearance and proceedings of their\\ncaptors. Contrary to the usages of the natives in the wantonness of\\ntheir success, they had respected, not only the persons of the trembling\\nsisters, but his own. The rich ornaments of his military attire had\\nindeed been repeatedly handled by different individuals of the tribe\\nwith eyes expressing a savage longing to possess the baubles; but before\\nthe customary violence could be resorted to, a mandate in the\\nauthoritative voice of the large warrior already mentioned, stayed the\\nuplifted hand, and convinced Heyward that they were to be reserved for\\nsome object of particular moment.\\n\\nWhile, however, these manifestations of weakness were exhibited by the\\nyoung and vain of the party, the more experienced warriors continued\\ntheir search throughout both caverns, with an activity that denoted they\\nwere far from being satisfied with those fruits of their conquest which\\nhad already been brought to light. Unable to discover any new victim,\\nthese diligent workers of vengeance soon approached their male\\nprisoners, pronouncing the name of \"La Longue Carabine,\" with a\\nfierceness that could not easily be mistaken. Duncan affected not to\\ncomprehend the meaning of their repeated and violent interrogatories,\\nwhile his companion was spared the effort of a similar deception by his\\nignorance of French. Wearied, at length, by their importunities, and\\napprehensive of irritating his captors by too stubborn a silence, the\\nformer looked about him in quest of Magua; who might interpret his\\nanswers to questions which were at each moment becoming more earnest and\\nthreatening.\\n\\nThe conduct of this savage had formed a solitary exception to that of\\nall his fellows. While the others were busily occupied in seeking to\\ngratify their childish passion for finery, by plundering even the\\nmiserable effects of the scout, or had been searching, with such\\nbloodthirsty vengeance in their looks, for their absent owner, Le Renard\\nhad stood at a little distance from the prisoners, with a demeanor so\\nquiet and satisfied, as to betray that he had already effected the grand\\npurpose of this treachery. When the eyes of Heyward first met those of\\nhis recent guide, he turned them away in horror at the sinister though\\ncalm look he encountered. Conquering his disgust, however, he was able,\\nwith an averted face, to address his successful enemy.\\n\\n\"Le Renard Subtil is too much of a warrior,\" said the reluctant Heyward,\\n\"to refuse telling an unarmed man what his conquerors say.\"\\n\\n\"They ask for the hunter who knows the paths through the woods,\"\\nreturned Magua, in his broken English, laying his hand, at the same\\ntime, with a ferocious smile, on the bundle of leaves with which a wound\\non his own shoulder was bandaged. \"La Longue Carabine! his rifle is\\ngood, and his eye never shut; but, like the short gun of the white\\nchief, it is nothing against the life of Le Subtil!\"\\n\\n\"Le Renard is too brave to remember the hurts received in war, or the\\nhands that gave them!\"\\n\\n\"Was it war, when the tired Indian rested at the sugar-tree to taste his\\ncorn! who filled the bushes with creeping enemies! who drew the knife!\\nwhose tongue was peace, while his heart was colored with blood! Did\\nMagua say that the hatchet was out of the ground, and that his hand had\\ndug it up?\"\\n\\nAs Duncan dared not retort upon his accuser by reminding him of his own\\npremeditated treachery, and disdained to deprecate his resentment by any\\nwords of apology, he remained silent. Magua seemed also content to rest\\nthe controversy as well as all further communication there, for he\\nresumed the leaning attitude against the rock, from which, in momentary\\nenergy, he had arisen. But the cry of \"La Longue Carabine\" was renewed\\nthe instant the impatient savages perceived that the short dialogue was\\nended.\\n\\n\"You hear,\" said Magua, with stubborn indifference; \"the red Hurons call\\nfor the life of \\'The Long Rifle,\\' or they will have the blood of them\\nthat keep him hid!\"\\n\\n\"He is gone--escaped; he is far beyond their reach.\"\\n\\nRenard smiled with cold contempt, as he answered,--\\n\\n\"When the white man dies, he thinks he is at peace; but the redmen know\\nhow to torture even the ghosts of their enemies. Where is his body? Let\\nthe Hurons see his scalp!\"\\n\\n\"He is not dead, but escaped.\"\\n\\nMagua shook his head incredulously.\\n\\n\"Is he a bird, to spread his wings; or is he a fish, to swim without\\nair! The white chief reads in his books, and he believes the Hurons are\\nfools!\"\\n\\n\"Though no fish, The Long Rifle can swim. He floated down the stream\\nwhen the powder was all burnt, and when the eyes of the Hurons were\\nbehind a cloud.\"\\n\\n\"And why did the white chief stay?\" demanded the still incredulous\\nIndian. \"Is he a stone that goes to the bottom, or does the scalp burn\\nhis head?\"\\n\\n\"That I am not a stone, your dead comrade, who fell into the falls,\\nmight answer, were the life still in him,\" said the provoked young man,\\nusing, in his anger, that boastful language which was most likely to\\nexcite the admiration of an Indian. \"The white man thinks none but\\ncowards desert their women.\"\\n\\nMagua muttered a few words, inaudibly, between his teeth, before he\\ncontinued, aloud,--\\n\\n\"Can the Delawares swim, too, as well as crawl in the bushes? Where is\\nLe Gros Serpent?\"\\n\\nDuncan, who perceived by the use of these Canadian appellations, that\\nhis late companions were much better known to his enemies than to\\nhimself, answered, reluctantly, \"He also is gone down with the water.\"\\n\\n\"Le Cerf Agile is not here?\"\\n\\n\"I know not whom you call \\'The Nimble Deer,\\'\" said Duncan, gladly\\nprofiting by any excuse to create delay.\\n\\n\"Uncas,\" returned Magua, pronouncing the Delaware name with even greater\\ndifficulty than he spoke his English words. \"\\'Bounding Elk\\' is what the\\nwhite man says, when he calls to the young Mohican.\"\\n\\n\"Here is some confusion in names between us, Le Renard,\" said Duncan,\\nhoping to provoke a discussion. \"_Daim_ is the French for deer, and\\n_cerf_ for stag; _elan_ is the true term, when one would speak of an\\nelk.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" muttered the Indian, in his native tongue; \"the pale-faces are\\nprattling women! they have two words for each thing, while a redskin\\nwill make the sound of his voice speak for him.\" Then changing his\\nlanguage, he continued, adhering to the imperfect nomenclature of his\\nprovincial instructors, \"The deer is swift, but weak; the elk is swift,\\nbut strong; and the son of Le Serpent is Le Cerf Agile. Has he leaped\\nthe river to the woods?\"\\n\\n\"If you mean the younger Delaware, he too is gone down with the water.\"\\n\\nAs there was nothing improbable to an Indian in the manner of the\\nescape, Magua admitted the truth of what he had heard, with a readiness\\nthat afforded additional evidence how little he would prize such\\nworthless captives. With his companions, however, the feeling was\\nmanifestly different.\\n\\nThe Hurons had awaited the result of this short dialogue with\\ncharacteristic patience, and with a silence that increased until there\\nwas a general stillness in the band. When Heyward ceased to speak, they\\nturned their eyes, as one man, on Magua, demanding, in this expressive\\nmanner, an explanation of what had been said. Their interpreter pointed\\nto the river, and made them acquainted with the result, as much by the\\naction as by the few words he uttered. When the fact was generally\\nunderstood, the savages raised a frightful yell, which declared the\\nextent of their disappointment. Some ran furiously to the water\\'s edge,\\nbeating the air with frantic gestures, while others spat upon the\\nelement, to resent the supposed treason it had committed against their\\nacknowledged rights as conquerors. A few, and they not the least\\npowerful and terrific of the band, threw lowering looks, in which the\\nfiercest passion was only tempered by habitual self-command, at those\\ncaptives who still remained in their power; while one or two even gave\\nvent to their malignant feelings by the most menacing gestures, against\\nwhich neither the sex nor the beauty of the sisters was any protection.\\nThe young soldier made a desperate, but fruitless effort, to spring to\\nthe side of Alice, when he saw the dark hand of a savage twisted in the\\nrich tresses which were flowing in volumes over her shoulders, while a\\nknife was passed around the head from which they fell, as if to denote\\nthe horrid manner in which it was about to be robbed of its beautiful\\nornament. But his hands were bound; and at the first movement he made,\\nhe felt the grasp of the powerful Indian who directed the band, pressing\\nhis shoulder like a vise. Immediately conscious how unavailing any\\nstruggle against such an overwhelming force must prove, he submitted to\\nhis fate, encouraging his gentle companions by a few low and tender\\nassurances that the natives seldom failed to threaten more than they\\nperformed.\\n\\nBut, while Duncan resorted to these words of consolation to quiet the\\napprehensions of the sisters, he was not so weak as to deceive himself.\\nHe well knew that the authority of an Indian chief was so little\\nconventional, that it was oftener maintained by physical superiority\\nthan by any moral supremacy he might possess. The danger was, therefore,\\nmagnified exactly in proportion to the number of the savage spirits by\\nwhich they were surrounded. The most positive mandate from him who\\nseemed the acknowledged leader, was liable to be violated at each\\nmoment, by any rash hand that might choose to sacrifice a victim to the\\n_manes_ of some dead friend or relative. While, therefore, he sustained\\nan outward appearance of calmness and fortitude, his heart leaped into\\nhis throat, whenever any of their fierce captors drew nearer than common\\nto the helpless sisters, or fastened one of their sullen wandering looks\\non those fragile forms which were so little able to resist the slightest\\nassault.\\n\\nHis apprehensions were, however, greatly relieved, when he saw that the\\nleader had summoned his warriors to himself in council. Their\\ndeliberations were short, and it would seem, by the silence of most of\\nthe party, the decision unanimous. By the frequency with which the few\\nspeakers pointed in the direction of the encampment of Webb, it was\\napparent they dreaded the approach of danger from that quarter. This\\nconsideration probably hastened their determination, and quickened the\\nsubsequent movements.\\n\\nDuring this short conference, Heyward, finding a respite from his\\ngreatest fears, had leisure to admire the cautious manner in which the\\nHurons had made their approaches, even after hostilities had ceased.\\n\\nIt has already been stated, that the upper half of the island was a\\nnaked rock, and destitute of any other defences than a few scattered\\nlogs of drift-wood. They had selected this point to make their descent,\\nhaving borne the canoe through the wood around the cataract for that\\npurpose. Placing their arms in the little vessel, a dozen men clinging\\nto its sides had trusted themselves to the direction of the canoe, which\\nwas controlled by two of the most skilful warriors, in attitudes that\\nenabled them to command a view of the dangerous passage. Favored by this\\narrangement, they touched the head of the island at that point which had\\nproved so fatal to their first adventures, but with the advantages of\\nsuperior numbers, and the possession of fire-arms. That such had been\\nthe manner of their descent was rendered quite apparent to Duncan; for\\nthey now bore the light bark from the upper end of the rock, and placed\\nit in the water, near the mouth of the outer cavern. As soon as this\\nchange was made, the leader made signs to the prisoners to descend and\\nenter.\\n\\nAs resistance was impossible, and remonstrance useless, Heyward set the\\nexample of submission, by leading the way into the canoe, where he was\\nsoon seated with the sisters, and the still wondering David.\\nNotwithstanding the Hurons were necessarily ignorant of the little\\nchannels among the eddies and rapids of the stream, they knew the common\\nsigns of such a navigation too well to commit any material blunder. When\\nthe pilot chosen for the task of guiding the canoe had taken his\\nstation, the whole band plunged again into the river, the vessel glided\\ndown the current, and in a few moments the captives found themselves on\\nthe south bank of the stream, nearly opposite to the point where they\\nhad struck it the preceding evening.\\n\\nHere was held another short but earnest consultation, during which the\\nhorses, to whose panic their owners ascribed their heaviest misfortune,\\nwere led from the cover of the woods, and brought to the sheltered spot.\\nThe band now divided. The great chief so often mentioned, mounting the\\ncharger of Heyward, led the way directly across the river, followed by\\nmost of his people, and disappeared in the woods, leaving the prisoners\\nin charge of six savages, at whose head was Le Renard Subtil. Duncan\\nwitnessed all their movements with renewed uneasiness.\\n\\nHe had been fond of believing, from the uncommon forbearance of the\\nsavages, that he was reserved as a prisoner to be delivered to Montcalm.\\nAs the thoughts of those who are in misery seldom slumber, and the\\ninvention is never more lively than when it is stimulated by hope,\\nhowever feeble and remote, he had even imagined that the parental\\nfeelings of Munro were to be made instrumental in seducing him from his\\nduty to the king. For though the French commander bore a high character\\nfor courage and enterprise, he was also thought to be expert in those\\npolitical practices, which do not always respect the nicer obligations\\nof morality, and which so generally disgraced the European diplomacy of\\nthat period.\\n\\nAll those busy and ingenious speculations were now annihilated by the\\nconduct of his captors. That portion of the band who had followed the\\nhuge warrior took the route towards the foot of the Horican, and no\\nother expectation was left for himself and companions, than that they\\nwere to be retained as hopeless captives by their savage conquerors.\\nAnxious to know the worst, and willing, in such an emergency, to try the\\npotency of gold, he overcame his reluctance to speak to Magua.\\nAddressing himself to his former guide, who had now assumed the\\nauthority and manner of one who was to direct the future movements of\\nthe party, he said, in tones as friendly and confiding as he could\\nassume,--\\n\\n\"I would speak to Magua, what is fit only for so great a chief to hear.\"\\n\\nThe Indian turned his eyes on the young soldier scornfully, as he\\nanswered,--\\n\\n\"Speak; trees have no ears!\"\\n\\n\"But the red Hurons are not deaf; and counsel that is fit for the great\\nmen of a nation would make the young warriors drunk. If Magua will not\\nlisten, the officer of the king knows how to be silent.\"\\n\\nThe savage spoke carelessly to his comrades, who were busied, after\\ntheir awkward manner, in preparing the horses for the reception of the\\nsisters, and moved a little to one side, whither, by a cautious gesture,\\nhe induced Heyward to follow.\\n\\n\"Now speak,\" he said; \"if the words are such as Magua should hear.\"\\n\\n\"Le Renard Subtil has proved himself worthy of the honorable name given\\nto him by his Canada fathers,\" commenced Heyward; \"I see his wisdom, and\\nall that he has done for us, and shall remember it, when the hour to\\nreward him arrives. Yes! Renard has proved that he is not only a great\\nchief in council, but one who knows how to deceive his enemies!\"\\n\\n\"What has Renard done?\" coldly demanded the Indian.\\n\\n\"What! has he not seen that the woods were filled with outlying parties\\nof the enemies, and that the Serpent could not steal through them\\nwithout being seen? Then, did he not lose his path to blind the eyes of\\nthe Hurons? Did he not pretend to go back to his tribe, who had treated\\nhim ill, and driven him from their wigwams like a dog? And, when we saw\\nwhat he wished to do, did we not aid him, by making a false face, that\\nthe Hurons might think the white man believed that his friend was his\\nenemy? Is not all this true? And when Le Subtil had shut the eyes and\\nstopped the ears of his nation by his wisdom, did they not forget that\\nthey had once done him wrong, and forced him to flee to the Mohawks? And\\ndid they not leave him on the south side of the river, with their\\nprisoners, while they have gone foolishly on the north? Does not Renard\\nmean to turn like a fox on his footsteps, and to carry to the rich and\\ngray-headed Scotchman his daughters? Yes, Magua, I see it all, and I\\nhave already been thinking how so much wisdom and honesty should be\\nrepaid. First, the chief of William Henry will give as a great chief\\nshould for such a service. The medal[16] of Magua will no longer be of\\ntin, but of beaten gold; his horn will run over with powder; dollars\\nwill be as plenty in his pouch as pebbles on the shore of Horican; and\\nthe deer will lick his hand, for they will know it to be vain to fly\\nfrom the rifle he will carry! As for myself, I know not how to exceed\\nthe gratitude of the Scotchman, but I--yes, I will--\"\\n\\n\"What will the young chief who comes from towards the sun, give?\"\\ndemanded the Huron, observing that Heyward hesitated in his desire to\\nend the enumeration of benefits with that which might form the climax of\\nan Indian\\'s wishes.\\n\\n\"He will make the fire-water from the Islands in the salt lake flow\\nbefore the wigwam of Magua, until the heart of the Indian shall be\\nlighter than the feathers of the humming-bird, and his breath sweeter\\nthan the wild honeysuckle.\"\\n\\nLe Renard had listened gravely as Heyward slowly proceeded in his subtle\\nspeech. When the young man mentioned the artifice he supposed the Indian\\nto have practised on his own nation, the countenance of the listener was\\nveiled in an expression of cautious gravity. At the allusion to the\\ninjury which Duncan affected to believe had driven the Huron from his\\nnative tribe, a gleam of such ungovernable ferocity flashed from the\\nother\\'s eyes, as induced the adventurous speaker to believe he had\\nstruck the proper chord. And by the time he reached the part where he so\\nartfully blended the thirst of vengeance with the desire of gain, he\\nhad, at least, obtained a command of the deepest attention of the\\nsavage. The question put by Le Renard had been calm, and with all the\\ndignity of an Indian; but it was quite apparent, by the thoughtful\\nexpression of the listener\\'s countenance, that the answer was most\\ncunningly devised. The Huron mused a few moments, and then laying his\\nhand on the rude bandages of his wounded shoulder, he said, with some\\nenergy,--\\n\\n\"Do friends make such remarks?\"\\n\\n\"Would La Longue Carabine cut one so light on an enemy?\"\\n\\n\"Do the Delawares crawl upon those they love, like snakes, twisting\\nthemselves to strike?\"\\n\\n\"Would Le Gros Serpent have been heard by the ears of one he wished to\\nbe deaf?\"\\n\\n\"Does the white chief burn his powder in the faces of his brothers?\"\\n\\n\"Does he ever miss his aim, when seriously bent to kill?\" returned\\nDuncan, smiling with well acted sincerity.\\n\\nAnother long and deliberate pause succeeded these sententious questions\\nand ready replies. Duncan saw that the Indian hesitated. In order to\\ncomplete his victory, he was in the act of recommencing the enumeration\\nof the rewards, when Magua made an expressive gesture and said--\\n\\n\"Enough; Le Renard is a wise chief, and what he does will be seen. Go,\\nand keep the mouth shut. When Magua speaks, it will be the time to\\nanswer.\"\\n\\nHeyward, perceiving that the eyes of his companion were warily fastened\\non the rest of the band, fell back immediately, in order to avoid the\\nappearance of any suspicious confederacy with their leader. Magua\\napproached the horses, and affected to be well pleased with the\\ndiligence and ingenuity of his comrades. He then signed to Heyward to\\nassist the sisters into the saddles, for he seldom deigned to use the\\nEnglish tongue, unless urged by some motive of more than usual moment.\\n\\nThere was no longer any plausible pretext for delay; and Duncan was\\nobliged, however reluctantly, to comply. As he performed this office, he\\nwhispered his reviving hopes in the ears of the trembling females, who,\\nthrough dread of encountering the savage countenances of their captors,\\nseldom raised their eyes from the ground. The mare of David had been\\ntaken with the followers of the large chief; in consequence, its owner,\\nas well as Duncan, was compelled to journey on foot. The latter did not,\\nhowever, so much regret this circumstance, as it might enable him to\\nretard the speed of the party; for he still turned his longing looks in\\nthe direction of Fort Edward, in the vain expectation of catching some\\nsound from that quarter of the forest, which might denote the approach\\nof succor.\\n\\nWhen all were prepared, Magua made the signal to proceed, advancing in\\nfront to lead the party in person. Next followed David, who was\\ngradually coming to a true sense of his condition, as the effects of the\\nwound became less and less apparent. The sisters rode in his rear, with\\nHeyward at their side, while the Indians flanked the party, and brought\\nup the close of the march, with a caution that seemed never to tire.\\n\\nIn this manner they proceeded in uninterrupted silence, except when\\nHeyward addressed some solitary word of comfort to the females, or David\\ngave vent to the moanings of his spirit in piteous exclamations, which\\nhe intended should express the humility of resignation. Their direction\\nlay towards the south, and in a course nearly opposite to the road to\\nWilliam Henry. Notwithstanding this apparent adherence in Magua to the\\noriginal determination of his conquerors, Heyward could not believe his\\ntempting bait was so soon forgotten; and he knew the windings of an\\nIndian path too well, to suppose that its apparent course led directly\\nto its object, when artifice was at all necessary. Mile after mile was,\\nhowever, passed through the boundless woods, in this painful manner,\\nwithout any prospect of a termination to their journey. Heyward watched\\nthe sun, as he darted his meridian rays through the branches of the\\ntrees, and pined for the moment when the policy of Magua should change\\ntheir route to one more favorable to his hopes. Sometimes he fancied the\\nwary savage, despairing of passing the arm of Montcalm in safety, was\\nholding his way towards a well-known border settlement, where a\\ndistinguished officer of the crown, and a favored friend of the Six\\nNations, held his large possessions, as well as his usual residence. To\\nbe delivered into the hands of Sir William Johnson was far preferable to\\nbeing led into the wilds of Canada; but in order to effect even the\\nformer, it would be necessary to traverse the forest for many weary\\nleagues, each step of which was carrying him farther from the scene of\\nthe war, and, consequently, from the post, not only of honor, but of\\nduty.\\n\\nCora alone remembered the parting injunctions of the scout, and whenever\\nan opportunity offered, she stretched forth her arm to bend aside the\\ntwigs that met her hands. But the vigilance of the Indians rendered this\\nact of precaution both difficult and dangerous. She was often defeated\\nin her purpose, by encountering their watchful eyes, when it became\\nnecessary to feign an alarm she did not feel, and occupy the limb by\\nsome gesture of feminine apprehension. Once, and once only, was she\\ncompletely successful; when she broke down the bough of a large sumach,\\nand, by a sudden thought, let her glove fall at the same instant. This\\nsign, intended for those that might follow, was observed by one of her\\nconductors, who restored the glove, broke the remaining branches of the\\nbush in such a manner that it appeared to proceed from the struggling of\\nsome beast in its branches, and then laid his hand on his tomahawk, with\\na look so significant, that it put an effectual end to these stolen\\nmemorials of their passage.\\n\\nAs there were horses, to leave the prints of their footsteps, in both\\nbands of the Indians, this interruption cut off any probable hopes of\\nassistance being conveyed through the means of their trail.\\n\\nHeyward would have ventured a remonstrance, had there been anything\\nencouraging in the gloomy reserve of Magua. But the savage, during all\\nthis time, seldom turned to look at his followers, and never spoke. With\\nthe sun for his only guide, or aided by such blind marks as are only\\nknown to the sagacity of a native, he held his way along the barrens of\\npine, through occasional little fertile vales, across brooks and\\nrivulets, and over undulating hills, with the accuracy of instinct, and\\nnearly with the directness of a bird. He never seemed to hesitate.\\nWhether the path was hardly distinguishable, whether it disappeared, or\\nwhether it lay beaten and plain before him, made no sensible difference\\nin his speed or certainty. It seemed as if fatigue could not affect him.\\nWhenever the eyes of the wearied travellers rose from the decayed leaves\\nover which they trod, his dark form was to be seen glancing among the\\nstems of the trees in front, his head immovably fastened in a forward\\nposition, with the light plume on his crest fluttering in a current of\\nair, made solely by the swiftness of his own motion.\\n\\nBut all this diligence and speed were not without an object. After\\ncrossing a low vale, through which a gushing brook meandered, he\\nsuddenly ascended a hill, so steep and difficult of ascent, that the\\nsisters were compelled to alight, in order to follow. When the summit\\nwas gained, they found themselves on a level spot, but thinly covered\\nwith trees, under one of which Magua had thrown his dark form, as if\\nwilling and ready to seek that rest which was so much needed by the\\nwhole party.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            \"Cursed by my tribe\\n  If I forgive him.\"\\n\\n  _Shylock._\\n\\n\\nThe Indian had selected, for this desirable purpose, one of those steep,\\npyramidal hills, which bear a strong resemblance to artificial mounds,\\nand which so frequently occur in the valleys of America. The one in\\nquestion was high and precipitous; its top flattened, as usual; but with\\none of its sides more than ordinarily irregular. It possessed no other\\napparent advantage for a resting-place than in its elevation and form,\\nwhich might render defence easy, and surprise nearly impossible. As\\nHeyward, however, no longer expected that rescue which time and distance\\nnow rendered so improbable, he regarded these little peculiarities with\\nan eye devoid of interest, devoting himself entirely to the comfort and\\ncondolence of his feebler companions. The Narragansetts were suffered to\\nbrowse on the branches of the trees and shrubs that were thinly\\nscattered over the summit of the hill, while the remains of their\\nprovisions were spread under the shade of a beech, that stretched its\\nhorizontal limbs like a canopy above them.\\n\\nNotwithstanding the swiftness of their flight, one of the Indians had\\nfound an opportunity to strike a straggling fawn with an arrow, and had\\nborne the more preferable fragments of the victim patiently on his\\nshoulders, to the stopping-place. Without any aid from the science of\\ncookery, he was immediately employed, in common with his fellows, in\\ngorging himself with this digestible sustenance. Magua alone sat apart,\\nwithout participation in the revolting meal, and apparently buried in\\nthe deepest thought.\\n\\nThis abstinence, so remarkable in an Indian, when he possessed the means\\nof satisfying hunger, at length attracted the notice of Heyward. The\\nyoung man willingly believed that the Huron deliberated on the most\\neligible manner of eluding the vigilance of his associates. With a view\\nto assist his plans, by any suggestion of his own, and to strengthen the\\ntemptation, he left the beech, and straggled as if without an object, to\\nthe spot where Le Renard was seated.\\n\\n\"Has not Magua kept the sun in his face long enough to escape all danger\\nfrom the Canadians?\" he asked, as though no longer doubtful of the good\\nintelligence established between them; \"and will not the chief of\\nWilliam Henry be better pleased to see his daughters before another\\nnight may have hardened his heart to their loss, to make him less\\nliberal in his reward?\"\\n\\n\"Do the pale-faces love their children less in the morning than at\\nnight?\" asked the Indian, coldly.\\n\\n\"By no means,\" returned Heyward, anxious to recall his error, if he had\\nmade one; \"the white man may, and does often, forget the burial-place of\\nhis fathers; he sometimes ceases to remember those he should love and\\nhas promised to cherish; but the affection of a parent for his child is\\nnever permitted to die.\"\\n\\n\"And is the heart of the white-headed chief soft, and will he think of\\nthe babes that his squaws have given him? He is hard to his warriors,\\nand his eyes are made of stone!\"\\n\\n\"He is severe to the idle and wicked, but to the sober and deserving he\\nis a leader, but just and humane. I have known many fond and tender\\nparents, but never have I seen a man whose heart was softer towards his\\nchild. You have seen the gray-head in front of his warriors, Magua; but\\nI have seen his eyes swimming in water, when he spoke of those children\\nwho are now in your power!\"\\n\\nHeyward paused, for he knew not how to construe the remarkable\\nexpression that gleamed across the swarthy features of the attentive\\nIndian. At first it seemed as if the remembrance of the promised reward\\ngrew vivid in his mind, while he listened to the sources of parental\\nfeeling which were to assure its possession; but as Duncan proceeded,\\nthe expression of joy became so fiercely malignant, that it was\\nimpossible not to apprehend it proceeded from some passion more sinister\\nthan avarice.\\n\\n\"Go,\" said the Huron, suppressing the alarming exhibition in an instant,\\nin a death-like calmness of countenance; \"go to the dark-haired\\ndaughter, and say, Magua waits to speak. The father will remember what\\nthe child promises.\"\\n\\nDuncan, who interpreted this speech to express a wish for some\\nadditional pledge that the promised gifts should not be withheld,\\nslowly and reluctantly repaired to the place where the sisters were now\\nresting from their fatigue, to communicate its purport to Cora.\\n\\n\"You understand the nature of an Indian\\'s wishes,\" he concluded, as he\\nled her towards the place where she was expected, \"and must be prodigal\\nof your offers of powder and blankets. Ardent spirits are, however, the\\nmost prized by such as he; nor would it be amiss to add some boon from\\nyour own hand, with that grace you so well know how to practise.\\nRemember, Cora, that on your presence of mind and ingenuity even your\\nlife, as well as that of Alice, may in some measure depend.\"\\n\\n\"Heyward, and yours!\"\\n\\n\"Mine is of little moment; it is already sold to my king, and is a prize\\nto be seized by any enemy who may possess the power. I have no father to\\nexpect me, and but few friends to lament a fate which I have courted\\nwith the insatiable longings of youth after distinction. But hush! we\\napproach the Indian. Magua, the lady with whom you wish to speak is\\nhere.\"\\n\\nThe Indian rose slowly from his seat, and stood for near a minute silent\\nand motionless. He then signed with his hand for Heyward to retire,\\nsaying coldly,--\\n\\n\"When the Huron talks to the women, his tribe shut their ears.\"\\n\\nDuncan, still lingering, as if refusing to comply, Cora said, with a\\ncalm smile--\\n\\n\"You hear, Heyward, and delicacy at least should urge you to retire. Go\\nto Alice, and comfort her with our reviving prospects.\"\\n\\nShe waited until he had departed, and then turning to the native, with\\nthe dignity of her sex in her voice and manner, she added, \"What would\\nLe Renard say to the daughter of Munro?\"\\n\\n\"Listen,\" said the Indian, laying his hand firmly upon her arm, as if\\nwilling to draw her utmost attention to his words; a movement that Cora\\nas firmly but quietly repulsed, by extricating the limb from his grasp:\\n\"Magua was born a chief and a warrior among the red Hurons of the lakes;\\nhe saw the suns of twenty summers make the snows of twenty winters run\\noff in the streams, before he saw a pale-face; and he was happy! Then\\nhis Canada fathers came into the woods, and taught him to drink the\\nfire-water, and he became a rascal. The Hurons drove him from the graves\\nof his fathers, as they would chase the hunted buffalo. He ran down the\\nshores of the lakes, and followed their outlet to the \\'city of cannon.\\'\\nThere he hunted and fished, till the people chased him again through the\\nwoods into the arms of his enemies. The chief, who was born a Huron, was\\nat last a warrior among the Mohawks!\"\\n\\n\"Something like this I had heard before,\" said Cora, observing that he\\npaused to suppress those passions which began to burn with too bright a\\nflame, as he recalled the recollection of his supposed injuries.\\n\\n\"Was it the fault of Le Renard that his head was not made of rock? Who\\ngave him the fire-water? who made him a villain? \\'Twas the pale-faces,\\nthe people of your own color.\"\\n\\n\"And am I answerable that thoughtless and unprincipled men exist, whose\\nshades of countenance may resemble mine?\" Cora calmly demanded of the\\nexcited savage.\\n\\n\"No; Magua is a man, and not a fool; such as you never open their lips\\nto the burning stream: the Great Spirit has given you wisdom!\"\\n\\n\"What then have I to do, or say, in the matter of your misfortunes, not\\nto say of your errors?\"\\n\\n\"Listen,\" repeated the Indian, resuming his earnest attitude; \"when his\\nEnglish and French fathers dug up the hatchet, Le Renard struck the\\nwar-post of the Mohawks, and went out against his own nation. The\\npale-faces have driven the redskins from their hunting-grounds, and now\\nwhen they fight, a white man leads the way. The old chief at Horican,\\nyour father, was the great captain of our war-party. He said to the\\nMohawks do this, and do that, and he was minded. He made a law, that if\\nan Indian swallowed the fire-water, and came into the cloth wigwams of\\nhis warriors, it should not be forgotten. Magua foolishly opened his\\nmouth, and the hot liquor led him into the cabin of Munro. What did the\\ngray-head? let his daughter say.\"\\n\\n\"He forgot not his words, and did justice by punishing the offender,\"\\nsaid the undaunted daughter.\\n\\n\"Justice!\" repeated the Indian, casting an oblique glance of the most\\nferocious expression at her unyielding countenance; \"is it justice to\\nmake evil, and then punish for it? Magua was not himself; it was the\\nfire-water that spoke and acted for him! but Munro did not believe it.\\nThe Huron chief was tied up before all the pale-faced warriors, and\\nwhipped like a dog.\"\\n\\nCora remained silent, for she knew not how to palliate this imprudent\\nseverity on the part of her father, in a manner to suit the\\ncomprehension of an Indian.\\n\\n\"See!\" continued Magua, tearing aside the slight calico that very\\nimperfectly concealed his painted breast; \"here are scars given by\\nknives and bullets--of these a warrior may boast before his nation; but\\nthe gray-head has left marks on the back of the Huron chief, that he\\nmust hide, like a squaw, under this painted cloth of the whites.\"\\n\\n\"I had thought,\" resumed Cora, \"that an Indian warrior was patient, and\\nthat his spirit felt not, and knew not, the pain his body suffered.\"\\n\\n\"When the Chippewas tied Magua to the stake, and cut this gash,\" said\\nthe other, laying his finger on a deep scar, \"the Huron laughed in their\\nfaces, and told them, Women struck so light! His spirit was then in the\\nclouds! But when he felt the blows of Munro, his spirit lay under the\\nbirch. The spirit of a Huron is never drunk; it remembers forever!\"\\n\\n\"But it may be appeased. If my father has done you this injustice, show\\nhim how an Indian can forgive an injury, and take back his daughters.\\nYou have heard from Major Heyward--\"\\n\\nMagua shook his head, forbidding the repetition of offers he so much\\ndespised.\\n\\n\"What would you have?\" continued Cora, after a most painful pause, while\\nthe conviction forced itself on her mind that the too sanguine and\\ngenerous Duncan had been cruelly deceived by the cunning of the savage.\\n\\n\"What a Huron loves--good for good; bad for bad!\"\\n\\n\"You would then revenge the injury inflicted by Munro on his helpless\\ndaughters. Would it not be more like a man to go before his face, and\\ntake the satisfaction of a warrior?\"\\n\\n\"The arms of the pale-faces are long, and their knives sharp!\" returned\\nthe savage, with a malignant laugh: \"why should Le Renard go among the\\nmuskets of his warriors, when he holds the spirit of the gray-head in\\nhis hand?\"\\n\\n\"Name your intention, Magua,\" said Cora, struggling with herself to\\nspeak with steady calmness. \"Is it to lead us prisoners to the woods, or\\ndo you contemplate even some greater evil? Is there no reward, no means\\nof palliating the injury, and of softening your heart? At least, release\\nmy gentle sister, and pour out all your malice on me. Purchase wealth by\\nher safety, and satisfy your revenge with a single victim. The loss of\\nboth of his daughters might bring the aged man to his grave, and where\\nwould then be the satisfaction of Le Renard?\"\\n\\n\"Listen,\" said the Indian again. \"The light eyes can go back to the\\nHorican, and tell the old chief what has been done, if the dark-haired\\nwoman will swear by the Great Spirit of her fathers to tell no lie.\"\\n\\n\"What must I promise?\" demanded Cora, still maintaining a secret\\nascendency over the fierce native, by the collected and feminine dignity\\nof her presence.\\n\\n\"When Magua left his people, his wife was given to another chief; he has\\nnow made friends with the Hurons, and will go back to the graves of his\\ntribe, on the shores of the great lake. Let the daughter of the English\\nchief follow, and live in his wigwam forever.\"\\n\\nHowever revolting a proposal of such a character might prove to Cora,\\nshe retained, notwithstanding her powerful disgust, sufficient\\nself-command to reply, without betraying the weakness.\\n\\n\"And what pleasure would Magua find in sharing his cabin with a wife he\\ndid not love; one who would be of a nation and color different from his\\nown? It would be better to take the gold of Munro, and buy the heart of\\nsome Huron maid with his gifts.\"\\n\\nThe Indian made no reply for near a minute, but bent his fierce looks on\\nthe countenance of Cora, in such wavering glances, that her eyes sank\\nwith shame, under an impression that, for the first time, they had\\nencountered an expression that no chaste female might endure. While she\\nwas shrinking within herself, in dread of having her ears wounded by\\nsome proposal still more shocking than the last, the voice of Magua\\nanswered, in its tones of deepest malignancy--\\n\\n\"When the blows scorched the back of the Huron, he would know where to\\nfind a woman to feel the smart. The daughter of Munro would draw his\\nwater, hoe his corn, and cook his venison. The body of the gray-head\\nwould sleep among his cannon, but his heart would lie within reach of\\nthe knife of Le Subtil.\"\\n\\n\"Monster! well dost thou deserve thy treacherous name!\" cried Cora, in\\nan ungovernable burst of filial indignation. \"None but a fiend could\\nmeditate such a vengeance! But thou overratest thy power! You shall find\\nit is, in truth, the heart of Munro you hold, and that it will defy your\\nutmost malice!\"\\n\\nThe Indian answered this bold defiance by a ghastly smile, that showed\\nan unaltered purpose, while he motioned her away, as if to close the\\nconference forever. Cora, already regretting her precipitation, was\\nobliged to comply, for Magua instantly left the spot, and approached his\\ngluttonous comrades. Heyward flew to the side of the agitated female,\\nand demanded the result of a dialogue that he had watched at a distance\\nwith so much interest. But unwilling to alarm the fears of Alice, she\\nevaded a direct reply, betraying only by her countenance her utter want\\nof success, and keeping her anxious looks fastened on the slightest\\nmovements of their captors. To the reiterated and earnest questions of\\nher sister, concerning their probable destination, she made no other\\nanswer than by pointing towards the dark group, with an agitation she\\ncould not control, and murmuring, as she folded Alice to her bosom--\\n\\n\"There, there; read our fortunes in their faces; we shall see; we shall\\nsee!\"\\n\\nThe action, and the choked utterance of Cora, spoke more impressively\\nthan any words, and quickly drew the attention of her companions on that\\nspot where her own was riveted with an intenseness that nothing but the\\nimportance of the stake could create.\\n\\nWhen Magua reached the cluster of lolling savages, who, gorged with\\ntheir disgusting meal, lay stretched on the earth in brutal indulgence,\\nhe commenced speaking with the dignity of an Indian chief. The first\\nsyllables he uttered had the effect to cause his listeners to raise\\nthemselves in attitudes of respectful attention. As the Huron used his\\nnative language, the prisoners, notwithstanding the caution of the\\nnatives had kept them within the swing of their tomahawks, could only\\nconjecture the substance of his harrangue, from the nature of those\\nsignificant gestures with which an Indian always illustrates his\\neloquence.\\n\\nAt first, the language, as well as the action of Magua, appeared calm\\nand deliberate. When he had succeeded in sufficiently awakening the\\nattention of his comrades, Heyward fancied, by his pointing so\\nfrequently towards the direction of the great lakes, that he spoke of\\nthe land of their fathers, and of their distant tribe. Frequent\\nindications of applause escaped the listeners, who, as they uttered the\\nexpressive \"Hugh!\" looked at each other in commendation of the speaker.\\nLe Renard was too skilful to neglect his advantage. He now spoke of the\\nlong and painful route by which they had left those spacious grounds and\\nhappy villages, to come and battle against the enemies of their\\nCanadian fathers. He enumerated the warriors of the party; their\\nseveral merits; their frequent services to the nation; their wounds, and\\nthe number of the scalps they had taken. Whenever he alluded to any\\npresent (and the subtle Indian neglected none), the dark countenance of\\nthe flattered individual gleamed with exultation, nor did he even\\nhesitate to assert the truth of the words, by gestures of applause and\\nconfirmation. Then the voice of the speaker fell, and lost the loud,\\nanimated tones of triumph with which he had enumerated their deeds of\\nsuccess and victory. He described the cataract of Glenn\\'s; the\\nimpregnable position of its rocky island, with its caverns, and its\\nnumerous rapids and whirlpools; he named the name of La Longue Carabine,\\nand paused until the forest beneath them had sent up the last echo of a\\nloud and long yell, with which the hated appellation was received. He\\npointed towards the youthful military captive, and described the death\\nof a favorite warrior, who had been precipitated into the deep ravine by\\nhis hand. He not only mentioned the fate of him who, hanging between\\nheaven and earth, had presented such a spectacle of horror to the whole\\nband, but he acted anew the terrors of his situation, his resolution and\\nhis death, on the branches of a sapling; and, finally, he rapidly\\nrecounted the manner in which each of their friends had fallen, never\\nfailing to touch upon their courage, and their most acknowledged\\nvirtues. When this recital of events was ended, his voice once more\\nchanged, and became plaintive, and even musical, in its low guttural\\nsounds. He now spoke of the wives and children of the slain; their\\ndestitution; their misery, both physical and moral; their distance; and,\\nat last, of their unavenged wrongs. Then suddenly lifting his voice to a\\npitch of terrific energy, he concluded, by demanding,--\\n\\n\"Are the Hurons dogs to bear this? Who shall say to the wife of Menowgua\\nthat the fishes have his scalp, and that his nation have not taken\\nrevenge! Who will dare meet the mother of Wassawattimie, that scornful\\nwoman, with his hands clean! What shall be said to the old men when they\\nask us for scalps, and we have not a hair from a white head to give\\nthem! The women will point their fingers at us. There is a dark spot on\\nthe names of the Hurons, and it must be hid in blood!\"\\n\\nHis voice was no longer audible in the burst of rage which now broke\\ninto the air, as if the wood, instead of containing so small a band, was\\nfilled with the nation. During the foregoing address the progress of the\\nspeaker was too plainly read by those most interested in his success,\\nthrough the medium of the countenances of the men he addressed. They had\\nanswered his melancholy and mourning by sympathy and sorrow; his\\nassertions, by gestures of confirmation; and his boastings, with the\\nexultation of savages. When he spoke of courage, their looks were firm\\nand responsive; when he alluded to their injuries, their eyes kindled\\nwith fury; when he mentioned the taunts of the women, they dropped their\\nheads in shame; but when he pointed out their means of vengeance, he\\nstruck a chord which never failed to thrill in the breast of an Indian.\\nWith the first intimation that it was within their reach, the whole band\\nsprang upon their feet as one man; giving utterance to their rage in the\\nmost frantic cries, they rushed upon their prisoners in a body with\\ndrawn knives and uplifted tomahawks. Heyward threw himself between the\\nsisters and the foremost, whom he grappled with a desperate strength\\nthat for a moment checked his violence. This unexpected resistance gave\\nMagua time to interpose, and with rapid enunciation and animated\\ngesture, he drew the attention of the band again to himself. In that\\nlanguage he knew so well how to assume, he diverted his comrades from\\ntheir instant purpose, and invited them to prolong the misery of their\\nvictims. His proposal was received with acclamations, and executed with\\nthe swiftness of thought.\\n\\nTwo powerful warriors cast themselves on Heyward, while another was\\noccupied in securing the less active singing-master. Neither of the\\ncaptives, however, submitted without a desperate though fruitless\\nstruggle. Even David hurled his assailant to the earth; nor was Heyward\\nsecured until the victory over his companion enabled the Indians to\\ndirect their united force to that object. He was then bound and fastened\\nto the body of the sapling, on whose branches Magua had acted the\\npantomime of the falling Huron. When the young soldier regained his\\nrecollection, he had the painful certainty before his eyes that a common\\nfate was intended for the whole party. On his right was Cora, in a\\ndurance similar to his own, pale and agitated, but with an eye, whose\\nsteady look still read the proceedings of their enemies. On his left,\\nthe withes which bound her to a pine, performed that office for Alice\\nwhich her trembling limbs refused, and alone kept her fragile form from\\nsinking. Her hands were clasped before her in prayer, but instead of\\nlooking upwards towards that power which alone could rescue them, her\\nunconscious looks wandered to the countenance of Duncan with infantile\\ndependency. David had contended, and the novelty of the circumstance\\nheld him silent, in deliberation on the propriety of the unusual\\noccurrence.\\n\\nThe vengeance of the Hurons had now taken a new direction, and they\\nprepared to execute it with that barbarous ingenuity with which they\\nwere familiarized by the practice of centuries. Some sought knots, to\\nraise the blazing pile; one was riving the splinters of pine, in order\\nto pierce the flesh of their captives with the burning fragments; and\\nothers bent the tops of two saplings to the earth, in order to suspend\\nHeyward by the arms between the recoiling branches. But the vengeance of\\nMagua sought a deeper and a more malignant enjoyment.\\n\\nWhile the less refined monsters of the band prepared, before the eyes of\\nthose who were to suffer, these well known and vulgar means of torture,\\nhe approached Cora, and pointed out, with the most malign expression of\\ncountenance, the speedy fate that awaited her:--\\n\\n\"Ha!\" he added, \"what says the daughter of Munro? Her head is too good\\nto find a pillow in the wigwam of Le Renard; will she like it better\\nwhen it rolls about this hill a plaything for the wolves? Her bosom\\ncannot nurse the children of a Huron; she will see it spit upon by\\nIndians!\"\\n\\n\"What means the monster!\" demanded the astonished Heyward.\\n\\n\"Nothing!\" was the firm reply. \"He is a savage, a barbarous and ignorant\\nsavage, and knows not what he does. Let us find leisure, with our dying\\nbreath, to ask for him penitence and pardon.\"\\n\\n\"Pardon!\" echoed the fierce Huron, mistaking, in his anger, the meaning\\nof her words; \"the memory of an Indian is longer than the arm of the\\npale-faces; his mercy shorter than their justice! Say; shall I send the\\nyellow hair to her father, and will you follow Magua to the great lakes,\\nto carry his water, and feed him with corn?\"\\n\\nCora beckoned him away, with an emotion of disgust she could not\\ncontrol.\\n\\n\"Leave me,\" she said, with a solemnity that for a moment checked the\\nbarbarity of the Indian; \"you mingle bitterness in my prayers; you stand\\nbetween me and my God!\"\\n\\nThe slight impression produced on the savage was, however, soon\\nforgotten, and he continued pointing, with taunting irony, towards\\nAlice.\\n\\n\"Look! the child weeps! She is young to die! Send her to Munro, to comb\\nhis gray hairs, and keep life in the heart of the old man.\"\\n\\nCora could not resist the desire to look upon her youthful sister, in\\nwhose eyes she met an imploring glance, that betrayed the longings of\\nnature.\\n\\n\"What says he, dearest Cora?\" asked the trembling voice of Alice. \"Did\\nhe speak of sending me to our father?\"\\n\\nFor many moments the elder sister looked upon the younger, with a\\ncountenance that wavered with powerful and contending emotions. At\\nlength she spoke, though her tones had lost their rich and calm fulness,\\nin an expression of tenderness that seemed maternal.\\n\\n\"Alice,\" she said, \"the Huron offers us both life, nay, more than both;\\nhe offers to restore Duncan, our invaluable Duncan, as well as you, to\\nour friends--to our father--to our heart-stricken, childless father, if\\nI will bow down this rebellious, stubborn pride of mine, and consent--\"\\n\\nHer voice became choked, and clasping her hands, she looked upward, as\\nif seeking, in her agony, intelligence from a wisdom that was infinite.\\n\\n\"Say on,\" cried Alice; \"to what, dearest Cora? O, that the proffer were\\nmade to me! to save you, to cheer our aged father, to restore Duncan,\\nhow cheerfully could I die!\"\\n\\n\"Die!\" repeated Cora, with a calmer and a firmer voice, \"that were easy!\\nPerhaps the alternative may not be less so. He would have me,\" she\\ncontinued, her accents sinking under a deep consciousness of the\\ndegradation of the proposal, \"follow him to the wilderness; go to the\\nhabitations of the Hurons; to remain there: in short to become his wife!\\nSpeak, then, Alice; child of my affections! sister of my love! And you,\\ntoo, Major Heyward, aid my weak reason with your counsel. Is life to be\\npurchased by such a sacrifice? Will you, Alice, receive it at my hands\\nat such a price? And _you_, Duncan, guide me; control me between you;\\nfor I am wholly yours.\"\\n\\n\"Would I!\" echoed the indignant and astonished youth. \"Cora! Cora! you\\njest with our misery! Name not the horrid alternative again; the thought\\nitself is worse than a thousand deaths.\"\\n\\n\"That such would be _your_ answer, I well knew!\" exclaimed Cora, her\\ncheeks flushing, and her dark eyes once more sparkling with the\\nlingering emotions of a woman. \"What says my Alice? for her will I\\nsubmit without another murmur.\"\\n\\nAlthough both Heyward and Cora listened with painful suspense and the\\ndeepest attention, no sounds were heard in reply. It appeared as if the\\ndelicate and sensitive form of Alice would shrink into itself, as she\\nlistened to this proposal. Her arms had fallen lengthwise before her,\\nthe fingers moving in slight convulsions; her head dropped upon her\\nbosom, and her whole person seemed suspended against the tree, looking\\nlike some beautiful emblem of the wounded delicacy of her sex, devoid of\\nanimation, and yet keenly conscious. In a few moments, however, her head\\nbegan to move slowly, in a sign of deep, unconquerable disapprobation.\\n\\n\"No, no, no; better that we die as we have lived, together!\"\\n\\n\"Then die!\" shouted Magua, hurling his tomahawk with violence at the\\nunresisting speaker, and gnashing his teeth with a rage that could no\\nlonger be bridled, at this sudden exhibition of firmness in the one he\\nbelieved the weakest of the party. The axe cleaved the air in front of\\nHeyward, and cutting some of the flowing ringlets of Alice, quivered in\\nthe tree above her head. The sight maddened Duncan to desperation.\\nCollecting all his energies in one effort, he snapped the twigs which\\nbound him and rushed upon another savage who was preparing with loud\\nyells, and a more deliberate aim, to repeat the blow. They encountered,\\ngrappled, and fell to the earth together. The naked body of his\\nantagonist afforded Heyward no means of holding his adversary, who\\nglided from his grasp, and rose again with one knee on his chest,\\npressing him down with the weight of a giant. Duncan already saw the\\nknife gleaming in the air, when a whistling sound swept past him, and\\nwas rather accompanied, than followed, by the sharp crack of a rifle. He\\nfelt his breast relieved from the load it had endured; he saw the savage\\nexpression of his adversary\\'s countenance change to a look of vacant\\nwildness, when the Indian fell dead on the faded leaves by his side.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "   'summary_text': 'Though at first menaced by the Hurons, Heyward is held for questioning, but he has to turn for interpretation to Magua, whom he sees Hawkeye had wounded on the shoulder. When he finally convinces them that the three woodsmen have escaped, they are furious, and one savage grabs Alice by the hair in a mock scalping. Before real violence can occur, the chief calls a brief council and the entire party crosses to the south bank of the river where the horses are. Mounted on Heyward\\'s charger, the chief leads most of his people away across river, leaving the prisoners in charge of six Indians headed by Magua. The major tries to secure Magua\\'s help by privately implying that he and the redskin have been in collusion to fool the Hurons all along and by offering rewards. Although Heyward adopts the sententious speech of the Indians, Magua is noncommittal as the group heads south, the sisters mounted and the others afoot. Flanked by the Indians, Cora finds it difficult to leave signs on the trail; once when she drops a glove, she is detected and severely warned by one of their conductors. Never speaking, Magua steadily leads the way through the forests and hills until they finally reach a steep, pyramidal hill with a level summit and few trees -- a perfect place for defense and for avoiding surprise. While the warriors eat the raw meat of a fawn, Heyward again engages Magua in talk. Heyward\\'s expression of Munro\\'s love for his daughters brings a gleam of malignant joy to the Indian\\'s face, and the latter insists upon a private talk with Cora. He proudly tells her that he was born a chief but that, after the Canadians taught him to drink firewater, he was driven from his tribe. Once when working for Munro, he came into Munro\\'s cabin drunk and the latter had him tied up and whipped like a dog before the soldiers. He demands, is it \"justice to make evil, and then punish for it?\" Wanting injury for injury, he says he will let Alice go if Cora will come with him as his wife: \"The body of the gray-head would sleep among his cannon, but his heart would lie within reach of the knife of Le Subtil.\" Cora is indignant and returns to her fellow captives. Magua goes to the lolling savages and begins a skillful harangue, building their emotions to the point of rage and vengeance. As they rush upon their prisoners with drawn knives and uplifted tomahawks, Magua villainously invites them to prolong the victims\\' misery. Heyward and Gamut struggle to no avail, and all four are tied to saplings while splinters and fire are prepared for the torture. Magua again makes his proposal, and Cora leaves the decision to Alice, who hesitates in her weakness but finally says no. Gnashing his teeth, the Huron hurls his tomahawk just above Alice\\'s head, cutting some of her ringlets. Maddened, Heyward snaps his bonds and rushes upon another Indian who is about to throw his weapon. In the struggle, Heyward goes down and the Indian raises his knife fatally. But the crack of a rifle is heard, and the Indian\\'s look changes to vacant wildness as he falls dead on the faded leaves beside Heyward.',\n",
       "   'summary_analysis': 'These chapters are important for certain revelations and one presentation of status quo ante . The latter comes in Magua\\'s explaining his past; his noble birth and his deserved but ignoble treatment by Munro do not justify his present actions, but they do make him and his conduct believable. They also raise the questions of justice and the big context of shared responsibility. The revelations begin with Heyward\\'s learning of the fame of his two former Indian companions, Chingachgook as \"Le Gros Serpent\"  and Uncas as \"Le Cerf Agile\" . Magua makes clear not only his motives but also the alternative routes that he will let his vengeance take. Perhaps the most important is Gamut\\'s self-revelation when he struggles hand-to-hand with his captors: \"David had contended, and the novelty of the circumstance held him silent.\" The realities of frontier strife are beginning to impinge upon him. Two influences on Cooper\\'s fiction are also apparent. Indian lore comes forth in the figurative language of the natives, in the masterful and persuasive oratory of Magua, in the Hurons\\' contrasting silent patience and loud bloodthirstiness, and in methods of torture such as tying a man\\'s arms to the tops of two bent saplings that will recoil in different directions. Sentimental qualities appear in the reactions of the fragile Alice, in the extreme testing of Cora\\'s virtue and familial emotions, and in Heyward\\'s over-vocalized sense of duty and honor. Holding together all of these fictional elements is the plot device of the chase, through which a reversal of fortunes has occurred. Some of the pursued and some of the pursuers have exchanged their roles, while some have had relative security usurped by imminent danger and vice versa.',\n",

He and the Mohicans advance to hand-to-hand combat, Uncas jumping protectively in front of Cora and saving her a moment later by killing an Indian whose tomahawk has cut her bonds. Soon all the Hurons are dead except Magua, who is fighting with Chingachgook. The villain feigns death and escapes before Hawkeye can brain him with the butt of his rifle. Chingachgook scalps the dead while Uncas and Heyward assist the females and Hawkeye releases Gamut. The scout advises the singing master to give up his \\\\\"little tooting instrument\\\\\" for a useful weapon, and Gamut counters by arguing the fatality of Calvinistic doctrine found in books. Completely the practical man, Hawkeye disdainfully says that the only book worth reading is nature. Gamut\\'s response is to sing a song, but Hawkeye common-sensically reloads his rifle and sees that everyone is armed. Then they start their journey with the girls riding the Narragansets. They very shortly stop and clear the leaves and clay from a hidden mineral spring, and Hawkeye tells how the three of them, sagaciously aided by Uncas, had tracked the Hurons for twenty miles. After a simple cooked meal, they proceed towards the north where Fort William Henry lies.\", \"analysis\": \"This is another bloody chapter, but its thematic significance is in the views of Gamut and Hawkeye. At first the psalmodist seems to have learned nothing from his recent experiences, yet it is notable that, whereas before he has done little more than sing and mouth religious platitudes, he now turns to doctrine and argument as if he must go deeper into his beliefs to convince Hawkeye and perhaps himself. Although in this instance the Yankee\\'s singing is a retreat as the scout gets the better of the discussion, Cooper gives Gamut his due as a folklore figure, \\\\\"a minstrel of the western continent . . . after the spirit of his own age and country.\\\\\" Hawkeye says that the recent action \\\\\"was all foreordered, and for the best.\\\\\" But he will admit such only after events have actually occurred, not beforehand as Gamut\\'s Calvinistic predestination insists upon. As something of a deist, he reads God in nature: \\\\\"I know not but man may so deform his works in the settlement, as to leave that which is so clear in the wilderness a matter of doubt among traders and priests.\\\\\" A few minutes later talking about the unusual way the Narragansets have been trained to walk, he comments that \\\\\"natur\\' is sadly abused by man, when he once gets the mastery.\\\\\" His point is that people should not seek absolute mastery and try to rival God. Highly pragmatic, he finds that the greatest lesson taught by nature is humility. He is the noble, self-outcast frontiersman who has turned his back on the settlement to seek, as a thinking man, the freedom and simplicity of natural morality; and he prefers this even though  it entails danger and killing. Since Cooper is developing some interest between Uncas and Cora, just before mid-chapter he carefully presents Uncas as showing \\\\\"a sympathy that elevated him far above the intelligence, and advanced him probably centuries before the practices of his nation.\\\\\" Though he will not fully allow it later, Cooper is presently trying to make their mutual interest acceptable and believable.\"}',\n",
       "   'chapter': '\\n  \"_Clo._--I am gone, sir,\\n      And anon, sir,\\n  I\\'ll be with you again.\"\\n\\n  _Twelfth Night._\\n\\n\\nThe Hurons stood aghast at this sudden visitation of death on one of\\ntheir band. But, as they regarded the fatal accuracy of an aim which had\\ndared to immolate an enemy at so much hazard to a friend, the name of\\n\"La Longue Carabine\" burst simultaneously from every lip, and was\\nsucceeded by a wild and a sort of plaintive howl. The cry was answered\\nby a loud shout from a little thicket, where the incautious party had\\npiled their arms; and at the next moment, Hawkeye, too eager to load the\\nrifle he had regained, was seen advancing upon them, brandishing the\\nclubbed weapon, and cutting the air with wide and powerful sweeps. Bold\\nand rapid as was the progress of the scout, it was exceeded by that of a\\nlight and vigorous form which, bounding past him, leaped, with\\nincredible activity and daring, into the very centre of the Hurons,\\nwhere it stood, whirling a tomahawk, and flourishing a glittering knife,\\nwith fearful menaces, in front of Cora. Quicker than the thoughts could\\nfollow these unexpected and audacious movements, an image, armed in the\\nemblematic panoply of death, glided before their eyes, and assumed a\\nthreatening attitude at the other\\'s side. The savage tormentors recoiled\\nbefore these warlike intruders, and uttered as they appeared in such\\nquick succession, the often repeated and peculiar exclamation of\\nsurprise, followed by the well known and dreaded appellations of--\\n\\n\"Le Cerf Agile! Le Gros Serpent!\"\\n\\nBut the wary and vigilant leader of the Hurons was not so easily\\ndisconcerted. Casting his keen eyes around the little plain, he\\ncomprehended the nature of the assault at a glance, and encouraging his\\nfollowers by his voice as well as by his example, he unsheathed his long\\nand dangerous knife, and rushed with a loud whoop upon the expecting\\nChingachgook. It was the signal for a general combat. Neither party had\\nfire-arms, and the contest was to be decided in the deadliest manner;\\nhand to hand, with weapons of offence, and none of defence.\\n\\nUncas answered the whoop, and leaping on an enemy, with a single, well\\ndirected blow of his tomahawk, cleft him to the brain. Heyward tore the\\nweapon of Magua from the sapling, and rushed eagerly towards the fray.\\nAs the combatants were now equal in number, each singled an opponent\\nfrom the adverse band. The rush and blows passed with the fury of a\\nwhirlwind, and the swiftness of lightning. Hawkeye soon got another\\nenemy within reach of his arm, and with one sweep of his formidable\\nweapon he beat down the slight and inartificial defences of his\\nantagonist, crushing him to the earth with the blow. Heyward ventured to\\nhurl the tomahawk he had seized, too ardent to await the moment of\\nclosing. It struck the Indian he had selected on the forehead, and\\nchecked for an instant his onward rush. Encouraged by this slight\\nadvantage, the impetuous young man continued his onset, and sprang upon\\nhis enemy with naked hands. A single instant was enough to assure him of\\nthe rashness of the measure, for he immediately found himself fully\\nengaged, with all his activity and courage, in endeavoring to ward the\\ndesperate thrusts made with the knife of the Huron. Unable longer to\\nfoil an enemy so alert and vigilant, he threw his arms about him, and\\nsucceeded in pinning the limbs of the other to his side, with an iron\\ngrasp, but one that was far too exhausting to himself to continue long.\\nIn this extremity he heard a voice near him, shouting--\\n\\n\"Extarminate the varlets! no quarter to an accursed Mingo!\"\\n\\nAt the next moment, the breech of Hawkeye\\'s rifle fell on the naked head\\nof his adversary, whose muscles appeared to wither under the shock, as\\nhe sank from the arms of Duncan, flexible and motionless.\\n\\nWhen Uncas had brained his first antagonist, he turned, like a hungry\\nlion, to seek another. The fifth and only Huron disengaged at the first\\nonset had paused a moment, and then seeing that all around him were\\nemployed in the deadly strife, he sought, with hellish vengeance, to\\ncomplete the baffled work of revenge. Raising a shout of triumph, he\\nsprang towards the defenceless Cora, sending his keen axe, as the\\ndreadful precursor of his approach. The tomahawk grazed her shoulder,\\nand cutting the withes which bound her to the tree, left the maiden at\\nliberty to fly. She eluded the grasp of the savage, and reckless of her\\nown safety, threw herself on the bosom of Alice, striving with\\nconvulsed and ill-directed fingers, to tear asunder the twigs which\\nconfined the person of her sister. Any other than a monster would have\\nrelented at such an act of generous devotion to the best and purest\\naffection; but the breast of the Huron was a stranger to sympathy.\\nSeizing Cora by the rich tresses which fell in confusion about her form,\\nhe tore her from her frantic hold, and bowed her down with brutal\\nviolence to her knees. The savage drew the flowing curls through his\\nhand, and raising them on high with an outstretched arm, he passed the\\nknife around the exquisitely moulded head of his victim, with a taunting\\nand exulting laugh. But he purchased this moment of fierce gratification\\nwith the loss of the fatal opportunity. It was just then the sight\\ncaught the eye of Uncas. Bounding from his footsteps he appeared for an\\ninstant darting through the air, and descending in a ball he fell on the\\nchest of his enemy, driving him many yards from the spot, headlong and\\nprostrate. The violence of the exertion cast the young Mohican at his\\nside. They arose together, fought, and bled, each in his turn. But the\\nconflict was soon decided; the tomahawk of Heyward and the rifle of\\nHawkeye descended on the skull of the Huron, at the same moment that the\\nknife of Uncas reached his heart.\\n\\nThe battle was now entirely terminated, with the exception of the\\nprotracted struggle between Le Renard Subtil and Le Gros Serpent. Well\\ndid these barbarous warriors prove that they deserved those significant\\nnames which had been bestowed for deeds in former wars. When they\\nengaged, some little time was lost in eluding the quick and vigorous\\nthrusts which had been aimed at their lives. Suddenly darting on each\\nother, they closed, and came to the earth, twisted together like twining\\nserpents, in pliant and subtle folds. At the moment when the victors\\nfound themselves unoccupied, the spot where these experienced and\\ndesperate combatants lay, could only be distinguished by a cloud of dust\\nand leaves which moved from the centre of the little plain towards its\\nboundary, as if raised by the passage of a whirlwind. Urged by the\\ndifferent motives of filial affection, friendship, and gratitude,\\nHeyward and his companions rushed with one accord to the place,\\nencircling the little canopy of dust which hung above the warriors. In\\nvain did Uncas dart around the cloud, with a wish to strike his knife\\ninto the heart of his father\\'s foe; the threatening rifle of Hawkeye was\\nraised and suspended in vain, while Duncan endeavored to seize the\\nlimbs of the Huron with hands that appeared to have lost their power.\\nCovered, as they were, with dust and blood, the swift evolutions of the\\ncombatants seemed to incorporate their bodies into one. The death-like\\nlooking figure of the Mohican, and the dark form of the Huron, gleamed\\nbefore their eyes in such quick and confused succession, that the\\nfriends of the former knew not where nor when to plant the succoring\\nblow. It is true there were short and fleeting moments, when the fiery\\neyes of Magua were seen glittering, like the fabled organs of the\\nbasilisk, through the dusty wreath by which he was enveloped, and he\\nread by those short and deadly glances the fate of the combat in the\\npresence of his enemies; ere, however, any hostile hand could descend on\\nhis devoted head, its place was filled by the scowling visage of\\nChingachgook. In this manner the scene of the combat was removed from\\nthe centre of the little plain to its verge. The Mohican now found an\\nopportunity to make a powerful thrust with his knife; Magua suddenly\\nrelinquished his grasp, and fell backward without motion, and seemingly\\nwithout life. His adversary leaped on his feet, making the arches of the\\nforest ring with the sounds of triumph.\\n\\n\"Well done for the Delawares! victory to the Mohican!\" cried Hawkeye,\\nonce more elevating the butt of the long and fatal rifle; \"a finishing\\nblow from a man without a cross will never tell against his honor, nor\\nrob him of his right to the scalp.\"\\n\\nBut, at the very moment when the dangerous weapon was in the act of\\ndescending, the subtle Huron rolled swiftly from beneath the danger,\\nover the edge of the precipice, and falling on his feet, was seen\\nleaping, with a single bound, into the centre of a thicket of low\\nbushes, which clung along its sides. The Delawares, who had believed\\ntheir enemy dead, uttered their exclamation of surprise, and were\\nfollowing with speed and clamor, like hounds in open view of the deer,\\nwhen a shrill and peculiar cry from the scout instantly changed their\\npurpose, and recalled them to the summit of the hill.\\n\\n\"\\'Twas like himself,\" cried the inveterate forester, whose prejudices\\ncontributed so largely to veil his natural sense of justice in all\\nmatters which concerned the Mingos; \"a lying and deceitful varlet as he\\nis. An honest Delaware now, being fairly vanquished, would have lain\\nstill, and been knocked on the head, but these knavish Maquas cling to\\nlife like so many cats-o\\'-the-mountain. Let him go--let him go; \\'tis but\\none man, and he without rifle or bow, many a long mile from his French\\ncommerades; and, like a rattler that has lost his fangs, he can do no\\nfurther mischief, until such time as he, and we too, may leave the\\nprints of our moccasins over a long reach of sandy plain. See, Uncas,\"\\nhe added, in Delaware, \"your father is flaying the scalps already. It\\nmay be well to go round and feel the vagabonds that are left, or we may\\nhave another of them loping through the woods, and screeching like a jay\\nthat has been winged.\"\\n\\n[Illustration: _Copyright by Charles Scribner\\'s Sons_\\n\\nTHE FIGHT IN THE FOREST\\n\\n_The battle was now entirely terminated, with the exception of the\\nprotracted struggle between Le Renard Subtil and Le Gros Serpent_]\\n\\nSo saying, the honest, but implacable scout, made the circuit of the\\ndead, into whose senseless bosoms he thrust his long knife, with as much\\ncoolness as though they had been so many brute carcasses. He had,\\nhowever, been anticipated by the elder Mohican, who had already torn the\\nemblems of victory from the unresisting heads of the slain.\\n\\nBut Uncas, denying his habits, we had almost said his nature, flew with\\ninstinctive delicacy, accompanied by Heyward, to the assistance of the\\nfemales, and quickly releasing Alice, placed her in the arms of Cora. We\\nshall not attempt to describe the gratitude to the Almighty Disposer of\\nevents which glowed in the bosoms of the sisters, who were thus\\nunexpectedly restored to life and to each other. Their thanksgivings\\nwere deep and silent; the offerings of their gentle spirits, burning\\nbrightest and purest on the secret altars of their hearts; and their\\nrenovated and more earthly feelings exhibiting themselves in long and\\nfervent, though speechless caresses. As Alice rose from her knees, where\\nshe had sunk by the side of Cora, she threw herself on the bosom of the\\nlatter; and sobbed aloud the name of their aged father, while her soft,\\ndove-like eyes sparkled with the rays of hope.\\n\\n\"We are saved! we are saved!\" she murmured; \"to return to the arms of\\nour dear, dear father, and his heart will not be broken with grief. And\\nyou too, Cora, my sister; my more than sister, my mother; you too are\\nspared. And Duncan,\" she added, looking round upon the youth with a\\nsmile of ineffable innocence, \"even our own brave and noble Duncan has\\nescaped without a hurt.\"\\n\\nTo these ardent and nearly incoherent words Cora made no other answer\\nthan by straining the youthful speaker to her heart, as she bent over\\nher, in melting tenderness. The manhood of Heyward felt no shame in\\ndropping tears over this spectacle of affectionate rapture; and Uncas\\nstood, fresh and blood-stained from the combat, a calm, and, apparently,\\nan unmoved looker-on, it is true, but with eyes that had already lost\\ntheir fierceness, and were beaming with a sympathy that elevated him far\\nabove the intelligence, and advanced him probably centuries before the\\npractices of his nation.\\n\\nDuring this display of emotions so natural in their situation, Hawkeye,\\nwhose vigilant distrust had satisfied itself that the Hurons, who\\ndisfigured the heavenly scene, no longer possessed the power to\\ninterrupt its harmony, approached David, and liberated him from the\\nbonds he had, until that moment, endured with the most exemplary\\npatience.\\n\\n\"There,\" exclaimed the scout, casting the last withe behind him, \"you\\nare once more master of your own limbs, though you seem not to use them\\nwith greater judgment than that in which they were first fashioned. If\\nadvice from one who is not older than yourself, but who having lived\\nmost of his time in the wilderness, may be said to have experience\\nbeyond his years, will give no offence, you are welcome to my thoughts;\\nand these are, to part with the little tooting instrument in your jacket\\nto the first fool you meet with, and buy some useful we\\'pon with the\\nmoney, if it be only the barrel of a horseman\\'s pistol. By industry and\\ncare, you might thus come to some prefarment; for by this time, I should\\nthink, your eyes would plainly tell you that a carrion crow is a better\\nbird than a mocking thresher. The one will, at least, remove foul sights\\nfrom before the face of man, while the other is only good to brew\\ndisturbances in the woods, by cheating the ears of all that hear them.\"\\n\\n\"Arms and the clarion for the battle, but the song of thanksgiving to\\nthe victory!\" answered the liberated David. \"Friend,\" he added,\\nthrusting forth his lean, delicate hand towards Hawkeye, in kindness,\\nwhile his eyes twinkled and grew moist, \"I thank thee that the hairs of\\nmy head still grow where they were first rooted by Providence; for,\\nthough those of other men may be more glossy and curling, I have ever\\nfound mine own well suited to the brain they shelter. That I did not\\njoin myself to the battle, was less owing to disinclination, than to the\\nbonds of the heathen. Valiant and skilful hast thou proved thyself in\\nthe conflict, and I hereby thank thee, before proceeding to discharge\\nother and more important duties, because thou hast proved thyself well\\nworthy of a Christian\\'s praise.\"\\n\\n\"The thing is but a trifle, and what you may often see, if you tarry\\nlong among us,\" returned the scout, a good deal softened towards the\\nman of song, by this unequivocal expression of gratitude. \"I have got\\nback my old companion, \\'Killdeer,\\'\" he added, striking his hand on the\\nbreech of his rifle; \"and that in itself is a victory. These Iroquois\\nare cunning, but they outwitted themselves when they placed their\\nfire-arms out of reach; and had Uncas or his father been gifted with\\nonly their common Indian patience, we should have come in upon the\\nknaves with three bullets instead of one, and that would have made a\\nfinish of the whole pack; yon loping varlet, as well as his commerades.\\nBut \\'twas all foreordered, and for the best.\"\\n\\n\"Thou sayest well,\" returned David, \"and hast caught the true spirit of\\nChristianity. He that is to be saved will be saved, and he that is\\npredestined to be damned will be damned. This is the doctrine of truth,\\nand most consoling and refreshing it is to the true believer.\"\\n\\nThe scout, who by this time was seated, examining into the state of his\\nrifle with a species of parental assiduity, now looked up at the other\\nin a displeasure that he did not affect to conceal, roughly interrupting\\nfurther speech.\\n\\n\"Doctrine, or no doctrine,\" said the sturdy woodsman, \"\\'tis the belief\\nof knaves, and the curse of an honest man. I can credit that yonder\\nHuron was to fall by my hand, for with my own eyes I have seen it; but\\nnothing short of being a witness will cause me to think he had met with\\nany reward, or that Chingachgook, there, will be condemned at the final\\nday.\"\\n\\n\"You have no warranty for such an audacious doctrine, nor any covenant\\nto support it,\" cried David, who was deeply tinctured with the subtle\\ndistinctions which, in his time, and more especially in his province,\\nhad been drawn around the beautiful simplicity of revelation, by\\nendeavoring to penetrate the awful mystery of the divine nature,\\nsupplying faith by self-sufficiency, and by consequence, involving those\\nwho reasoned from such human dogmas in absurdities and doubt; \"your\\ntemple is reared on the sands, and the first tempest will wash away its\\nfoundation. I demand your authorities for such an uncharitable assertion\\n(like other advocates of a system, David was not always accurate in his\\nuse of terms). Name chapter and verse; in which of the holy books do you\\nfind language to support you?\"\\n\\n\"Book!\" repeated Hawkeye, with singular and ill-concealed disdain; \"do\\nyou take me for a whimpering boy at the apron-string of one of your old\\ngals; and this good rifle on my knee for the feather of a goose\\'s wing,\\nmy ox\\'s horn for a bottle of ink, and my leathern pouch for a\\ncross-barred handkercher to carry my dinner? Book! what have such as I,\\nwho am a warrior of the wilderness, though a man without a cross, to do\\nwith books? I never read but in one, and the words that are written\\nthere are too simple and too plain to need much schooling; though I may\\nboast that of forty long and hard-working years.\"\\n\\n\"What call you the volume?\" said David, misconceiving the other\\'s\\nmeaning.\\n\\n\"Tis open before your eyes,\" returned the scout; \"and he who owns it is\\nnot a niggard of its use. I have heard it said that there are men who\\nread in books to convince themselves there is a God. I know not but man\\nmay so deform his works in the settlement, as to leave that which is so\\nclear in the wilderness a matter of doubt among traders and priests. If\\nany such there be, and he will follow me from sun to sun, through the\\nwindings of the forest, he shall see enough to teach him that he is a\\nfool, and that the greatest of his folly lies in striving to rise to the\\nlevel of One he can never equal, be it in goodness, or be it in power.\"\\n\\nThe instant David discovered that he battled with a disputant who\\nimbibed his faith from the lights of nature, eschewing all subtleties of\\ndoctrine, he willingly abandoned a controversy from which he believed\\nneither profit nor credit was to be derived. While the scout was\\nspeaking, he had also seated himself, and producing the ready little\\nvolume and the iron-rimmed spectacles, he prepared to discharge a duty,\\nwhich nothing but the unexpected assault he had received in his\\northodoxy could have so long suspended. He was, in truth, a minstrel of\\nthe western continent--of a much later day, certainly, than those gifted\\nbards, who formerly sang the profane renown of baron and prince, but\\nafter the spirit of his own age and country; and he was now prepared to\\nexercise the cunning of his craft, in celebration of, or rather in\\nthanksgiving for, the recent victory. He waited patiently for Hawkeye to\\ncease, then lifting his eyes, together with his voice, he said, aloud,--\\n\\n\"I invite you, friends, to join in praise for this signal deliverance\\nfrom the hands of barbarians and infidels, to the comfortable and solemn\\ntones of the tune, called \\'Northampton.\\'\"\\n\\nHe next named the page and verse where the rhymes selected were to be\\nfound, and applied the pitch-pipe to his lips, with the decent gravity\\nthat he had been wont to use in the temple. This time he was, however,\\nwithout any accompaniment, for the sisters were just then pouring out\\nthose tender effusions of affection which have been already alluded to.\\nNothing deterred by the smallness of his audience, which, in truth,\\nconsisted only of the discontented scout, he raised his voice,\\ncommencing and ending the sacred song without accident or interruption\\nof any kind.\\n\\nHawkeye listened, while he coolly adjusted his flint and reloaded his\\nrifle; but the sounds, wanting the extraneous assistance of scene and\\nsympathy, failed to awaken his slumbering emotions. Never minstrel, or\\nby whatever more suitable name David should be known, drew upon his\\ntalents in the presence of more insensible auditors; though considering\\nthe singleness and sincerity of his motive, it is probable that no bard\\nof profane song ever uttered notes that ascended so near to that throne\\nwhere all homage and praise is due. The scout shook his head, and\\nmuttering some unintelligible words, among which \"throat\" and\\n\"Iroquois,\" were alone audible, he walked away, to collect, and to\\nexamine into, the state of the captured arsenal of the Hurons. In this\\noffice he was now joined by Chingachgook, who found his own, as well as\\nthe rifle of his son, among the arms. Even Heyward and David were\\nfurnished with weapons; nor was ammunition wanting to render them all\\neffectual.\\n\\nWhen the foresters had made their selection, and distributed their\\nprizes, the scout announced that the hour had arrived when it was\\nnecessary to move. By this time the song of Gamut had ceased, and the\\nsisters had learned to still the exhibition of their emotions. Aided by\\nDuncan and the younger Mohican, the two latter descended the precipitous\\nsides of that hill which they had so lately ascended under so very\\ndifferent auspices, and whose summit had so nearly proved the scene of\\ntheir massacre. At the foot, they found the Narragansetts browsing the\\nherbage of the bushes; and having mounted, they followed the movements\\nof a guide, who, in the most deadly straits, had so often proved himself\\ntheir friend. The journey was, however, short. Hawkeye, leaving the\\nblind path that the Hurons had followed, turned short to his right, and\\nentering the thicket, he crossed a babbling brook, and halted in a\\nnarrow dell, under the shade of a few water elms. Their distance from\\nthe base of the fatal hill was but a few rods, and the steeds had been\\nserviceable only in crossing the shallow stream.\\n\\nThe scout and the Indians appeared to be familiar with the sequestered\\nplace where they now were; for, leaning their rifles against the trees,\\nthey commenced throwing aside the dried leaves, and opening the blue\\nclay, out of which a clear and sparkling spring of bright, glancing\\nwater, quickly bubbled. The white man then looked about him, as though\\nseeking for some object, which was not to be found as readily as he\\nexpected:--\\n\\n\"Them careless imps, the Mohawks, with their Tuscarora and Onondaga\\nbrethren, have been here slaking their thirst,\" he muttered, \"and the\\nvagabonds have thrown away the gourd! This is the way with benefits,\\nwhen they are bestowed on such disremembering hounds! Here has the Lord\\nlaid his hand, in the midst of the howling wilderness, for their good,\\nand raised a fountain of water from the bowels of the \\'arth, that might\\nlaugh at the richest shop of apothecary\\'s ware in all the colonies; and\\nsee! the knaves have trodden in the clay, and deformed the cleanliness\\nof the place, as though they were brute beasts, instead of human men.\"\\n\\nUncas silently extended towards him the desired gourd, which the spleen\\nof Hawkeye had hitherto prevented him from observing, on a branch of an\\nelm. Filling it with water, he retired a short distance, to a place\\nwhere the ground was more firm and dry; here he coolly seated himself,\\nand after taking a long, and, apparently, a grateful draught, he\\ncommenced a very strict examination of the fragments of food left by the\\nHurons, which had hung in a wallet on his arm.\\n\\n\"Thank you, lad!\" he continued, returning the empty gourd to Uncas; \"now\\nwe will see how these rampaging Hurons lived, when outlying in\\nambushments. Look at this! The varlets know the better pieces of the\\ndeer; and one would think they might carve and roast a saddle, equal to\\nthe best cook in the land! But everything is raw, for the Iroquois are\\nthorough savages. Uncas, take my steel, and kindle a fire; a mouthful of\\na tender broil will give natur\\' a helping hand, after so long a trail.\"\\n\\nHeyward, perceiving that their guides now set about their repast in\\nsober earnest, assisted the ladies to alight, and placed himself at\\ntheir side, not unwilling to enjoy a few moments of grateful rest, after\\nthe bloody scene he had just gone through. While the culinary process\\nwas in hand, curiosity induced him to inquire into the circumstances\\nwhich had led to their timely and unexpected rescue:--\\n\\n\"How is it that we see you so soon, my generous friend,\" he asked, \"and\\nwithout aid from the garrison of Edward?\"\\n\\n\"Had we gone to the bend in the river, we might have been in time to\\nrake the leaves over your bodies, but too late to have saved your\\nscalps,\" coolly answered the scout. \"No, no; instead of throwing away\\nstrength and opportunity by crossing to the fort, we lay by, under the\\nbank of the Hudson, waiting to watch the movements of the Hurons.\"\\n\\n\"You were, then, witnesses of all that passed?\"\\n\\n\"Not of all; for Indian sight is too keen to be easily cheated, and we\\nkept close. A difficult matter it was, too, to keep this Mohican boy\\nsnug in the ambushment. Ah! Uncas, Uncas, your behavior was more like\\nthat of a curious woman than of a warrior on his scent.\"\\n\\nUncas permitted his eyes to turn for an instant on the sturdy\\ncountenance of the speaker, but he neither spoke nor gave any indication\\nof repentance. On the contrary, Heyward thought the manner of the young\\nMohican was disdainful, if not a little fierce, and that he suppressed\\npassions that were ready to explode, as much in compliment to the\\nlisteners, as from the deference he usually paid to his white associate.\\n\\n\"You saw our capture?\" Heyward next demanded.\\n\\n\"We heard it,\" was the significant answer. \"An Indian yell is plain\\nlanguage to men who have passed their days in the woods. But when you\\nlanded, we were driven to crawl, like sarpents, beneath the leaves; and\\nthen we lost sight of you entirely, until we placed eyes on you again,\\ntrussed to the trees, and ready bound for an Indian massacre.\"\\n\\n\"Our rescue was the deed of Providence. It was nearly a miracle that you\\ndid not mistake the path, for the Hurons divided, and each band had its\\nhorses.\"\\n\\n\"Ay! there we were thrown off the scent, and might, indeed, have lost\\nthe trail, had it not been for Uncas; we took the path, however, that\\nled into the wilderness; for we judged, and judged rightly, that the\\nsavages would hold that course with their prisoners. But when we had\\nfollowed it for many miles, without finding a single twig broken, as I\\nhad advised, my mind misgave me; especially as all the footsteps had the\\nprints of moccasins.\"\\n\\n\"Our captors had the precaution to see us shod like themselves,\" said\\nDuncan, raising a foot, and exhibiting the buckskin he wore.\\n\\n\"Ay, \\'twas judgmatical, and like themselves; though we were too expart\\nto be thrown from a trail by so common an invention.\"\\n\\n\"To what, then, are we indebted for our safety?\"\\n\\n\"To what, as a white man who has no taint of Indian blood, I should be\\nashamed to own; to the judgment of the young Mohican, in matters which I\\nshould know better than he, but which I can now hardly believe to be\\ntrue, though my own eyes tell me it is so.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis extraordinary! will you not name the reason?\"\\n\\n\"Uncas was bold enough to say, that the beasts ridden by the gentle\\nones,\" continued Hawkeye, glancing his eyes, not without curious\\ninterest, on the fillies of the ladies, \"planted the legs of one side on\\nthe ground at the same time, which is contrary to the movements of all\\ntrotting four-footed animals of my knowledge, except the bear. And yet\\nhere are horses that always journey in this manner, as my own eyes have\\nseen, and as their trail has shown for twenty long miles.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis the merit of the animal! They come from the shores of\\nNarragansett Bay, in the small province of Providence Plantations, and\\nare celebrated for their hardihood, and the ease of this peculiar\\nmovement; though other horses are not unfrequently trained to the same.\"\\n\\n\"It may be--it may be,\" said Hawkeye, who had listened with singular\\nattention to this explanation; \"though I am a man who has the full blood\\nof the whites, my judgment in deer and beaver is greater than in beasts\\nof burden. Major Effingham has many noble chargers, but I have never\\nseen one travel after such a sideling gait.\"\\n\\n\"True; for he would value the animals for very different properties.\\nStill is this a breed highly esteemed, and as you witness, much honored\\nwith the burdens it is often destined to bear.\"\\n\\nThe Mohicans had suspended their operations about the glimmering fire,\\nto listen; and when Duncan had done, they looked at each other\\nsignificantly, the father uttering the never-failing exclamation of\\nsurprise. The scout ruminated, like a man digesting his newly acquired\\nknowledge, and once more stole a curious glance at the horses.\\n\\n\"I dare to say there are even stranger sights to be seen in the\\nsettlements!\" he said, at length; \"natur\\' is sadly abused by man, when\\nhe once gets the mastery. But, go sideling or go straight, Uncas had\\nseen the movement, and their trail led us on to the broken bush. The\\nouter branch, near the prints of one of the horses, was bent upward, as\\na lady breaks a flower from its stem, but all the rest were ragged and\\nbroken down, as if the strong hand of a man had been tearing them! So I\\nconcluded that the cunning varmints had seen the twig bent, and had torn\\nthe rest, to make us believe a buck had been feeling the boughs with his\\nantlers.\"\\n\\n\"I do believe your sagacity did not deceive you; for some such thing\\noccurred!\"\\n\\n\"That was easy to see,\" added the scout, in no degree conscious of\\nhaving exhibited any extraordinary sagacity; \"and a very different\\nmatter it was from a waddling horse! It then struck me the Mingos would\\npush for this spring, for the knaves well know the vartue of its\\nwaters!\"\\n\\n\"Is it, then, so famous?\" demanded Heyward, examining, with a more\\ncurious eye, the secluded dell, with its bubbling fountain, surrounded,\\nas it was, by earth of a deep dingy brown.\\n\\n\"Few redskins, who travel south and east of the great lakes, but have\\nheard of its qualities. Will you taste for yourself?\"\\n\\nHeyward took the gourd, and after swallowing a little of the water,\\nthrew it aside with grimaces of discontent. The scout laughed in his\\nsilent, but heartfelt manner, and shook his head with vast satisfaction.\\n\\n\"Ah! you want the flavor that one gets by habit; the time was when I\\nliked it as little as yourself; but I have come to my taste, and I now\\ncrave it, as a deer does the licks.[17] Your high spiced wines are not\\nbetter liked than a redskin relishes this water; especially when his\\nnatur\\' is ailing. But Uncas has made his fire, and it is time we think\\nof eating, for our journey is long, and all before us.\"\\n\\nInterrupting the dialogue by this abrupt transition, the scout had\\ninstant recourse to the fragments of food which had escaped the voracity\\nof the Hurons. A very summary process completed the simple cookery, when\\nhe and the Mohicans commenced their humble meal, with the silence and\\ncharacteristic diligence of men who ate in order to enable themselves\\nto endure great and unremitting toil.\\n\\nWhen this necessary, and, happily, grateful duty had been performed,\\neach of the foresters stooped and took a long and parting draught at\\nthat solitary and silent spring,[18] around which and its sister\\nfountains, within fifty years, the wealth, beauty, and talents of a\\nhemisphere were to assemble in throngs, in pursuit of health and\\npleasure. Then Hawkeye announced his determination to proceed. The\\nsisters resumed their saddles; Duncan and David grasped their rifles,\\nand followed on their footsteps; the scout leading the advance, and the\\nMohicans bringing up the rear. The whole party moved swiftly through the\\nnarrow path, towards the north, leaving the healing waters to mingle\\nunheeded with the adjacent brook, and the bodies of the dead to fester\\non the neighboring mount, without the rites of sepulture; a fate but too\\ncommon to the warriors of the woods to excite either commiseration or\\ncomment.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "   'summary_text': 'Since the Indians\\' rifles have been placed to the side, Hawkeye has found his, loaded it, and fired it. He and the Mohicans advance to hand-to-hand combat, Uncas jumping protectively in front of Cora and saving her a moment later by killing an Indian whose tomahawk has cut her bonds. Soon all the Hurons are dead except Magua, who is fighting with Chingachgook. The villain feigns death and escapes before Hawkeye can brain him with the butt of his rifle. Chingachgook scalps the dead while Uncas and Heyward assist the females and Hawkeye releases Gamut. The scout advises the singing master to give up his \"little tooting instrument\" for a useful weapon, and Gamut counters by arguing the fatality of Calvinistic doctrine found in books. Completely the practical man, Hawkeye disdainfully says that the only book worth reading is nature. Gamut\\'s response is to sing a song, but Hawkeye common-sensically reloads his rifle and sees that everyone is armed. Then they start their journey with the girls riding the Narragansets. They very shortly stop and clear the leaves and clay from a hidden mineral spring, and Hawkeye tells how the three of them, sagaciously aided by Uncas, had tracked the Hurons for twenty miles. After a simple cooked meal, they proceed towards the north where Fort William Henry lies.',\n",
       "   'summary_analysis': 'This is another bloody chapter, but its thematic significance is in the views of Gamut and Hawkeye. At first the psalmodist seems to have learned nothing from his recent experiences, yet it is notable that, whereas before he has done little more than sing and mouth religious platitudes, he now turns to doctrine and argument as if he must go deeper into his beliefs to convince Hawkeye and perhaps himself. Although in this instance the Yankee\\'s singing is a retreat as the scout gets the better of the discussion, Cooper gives Gamut his due as a folklore figure, \"a minstrel of the western continent . . . after the spirit of his own age and country.\" Hawkeye says that the recent action \"was all foreordered, and for the best.\" But he will admit such only after events have actually occurred, not beforehand as Gamut\\'s Calvinistic predestination insists upon. As something of a deist, he reads God in nature: \"I know not but man may so deform his works in the settlement, as to leave that which is so clear in the wilderness a matter of doubt among traders and priests.\" A few minutes later talking about the unusual way the Narragansets have been trained to walk, he comments that \"natur\\' is sadly abused by man, when he once gets the mastery.\" His point is that people should not seek absolute mastery and try to rival God. Highly pragmatic, he finds that the greatest lesson taught by nature is humility. He is the noble, self-outcast frontiersman who has turned his back on the settlement to seek, as a thinking man, the freedom and simplicity of natural morality; and he prefers this even though  it entails danger and killing. Since Cooper is developing some interest between Uncas and Cora, just before mid-chapter he carefully presents Uncas as showing \"a sympathy that elevated him far above the intelligence, and advanced him probably centuries before the practices of his nation.\" Though he will not fully allow it later, Cooper is presently trying to make their mutual interest acceptable and believable.',\n",

Under the hillock are the long-dead Mohawks, the memory of whom makes Hawkeye once again refer to the two Mohicans as the last of their tribe. All except Chingachgook fall asleep and awaken at the rising of the moon to continue their journey. Before they can leave, they hear the steps of some twenty enemy Indians who have apparently lost their trail. While the protagonists wait in quiet suspense, two Hurons approach the mound but warily withdraw out of respect for the dead. As soon as the sounds of the hunters completely fade away, the seven fugitives silently head north again. After tactically walking barefoot in a stream for an hour, they turn again to the plain and reach the \\\\\"bloody pond,\\\\\" where in a previous battle Frenchmen had been surprised, slain, and tossed into the water. Being now near the French outposts, they encounter a French sentinel, whom Heyward fools by answering in French and whom Chingachgook slips upon, kills, and scalps. Since they must turn back for safety, Hawkeye leads them up a mountain from which, as morning comes, they can see to the east Fort William Henry on the southern tip of Lake George. Between them and the fort are General Montcalm\\'s ten thousand Frenchmen, while to the southeast is the camped detachment from Fort Edward. Firing has already started, but as a great fog descends, the party plans to push through it to the fort. They have strayed from their way when a cannon ball from the fort rolls to a stop near them and they decide to follow its furrow to safety. Again running into French forces, they have to flee and become lost until Uncas finds the furrow again. They are hotly pursued, but within minutes they are beneath the walls of the fort, where Munro recognizes the voice of Alice and orders his men out the sally-port. Led by Heyward, the English disperse the French as the gigantic, grey-haired Munro, large tears rolling down his cheeks, embraces his two daughters in his arms.\", \"analysis\": \"The story has now reached the end of the first long chase, during which one pattern of pursuit-capture-escape-and-pursuit is completed. But Cooper has made sure that the present safety for the main characters is only relative. He has made the reader aware that the defending English are far outnumbered and contained by the ten thousand French and their Indian allies; even the sentimental reader who may feel relief and a gush of emotional release at the reunion of the father and daughters knows that the protagonists now face the double danger of foes and can no longer maneuver as they did in the forests. If any lull is to come, it will be in terms of action, not suspense. The action here is so intense that little individual characterization is presented. Gamut is barely present, and Uncas apparently has no chance to show his interest in Cora. At one point Hawkeye relates some of the history of the tribe of Mohicans, and his reference to his two companions keeps alive the background theme of tribal demise. But rather than its setting him apart as an individual, Chingachgook\\'s taking of scalps merely shows how much he still has in common with all other Indians, though his actions do stand in contrast to Uncas\\' behavior in the preceding chapter. Hawkeye, who sees Chingachgook\\'s actions as part of his Indian \\\\\"gift,\\\\\" evinces one new character element with his superstition at the \\\\\"bloody pond.\\\\\" However, since Cooper is busy rounding out his action, he does not dwell on theme or characterization in these moments.\"}',\n",
       "   'chapter': '\\n  \"I\\'ll seek a readier path.\"\\n\\n  PARNELL.\\n\\n\\nThe route taken by Hawkeye lay across those sandy plains, relieved by\\noccasional valleys and swells of land, which had been traversed by their\\nparty on the morning of the same day, with the baffled Magua for their\\nguide. The sun had now fallen low towards the distant mountains; and as\\ntheir journey lay through the interminable forest, the heat was no\\nlonger oppressive. Their progress, in consequence, was proportionate;\\nand long before the twilight gathered about them, they had made good\\nmany toilsome miles on their return.\\n\\nThe hunter, like the savage whose place he filled, seemed to select\\namong the blind signs of their wild route, with a species of instinct,\\nseldom abating his speed, and never pausing to deliberate. A rapid and\\noblique glance at the moss on the trees, with an occasional upward gaze\\ntowards the setting sun, or a steady but passing look at the direction\\nof the numerous water-courses, through which he waded, were sufficient\\nto determine his path, and remove his greatest difficulties. In the\\nmeantime, the forest began to change its hues, losing that lively green\\nwhich had embellished its arches, in the graver light which is the usual\\nprecursor of the close of day.\\n\\nWhile the eyes of the sisters were endeavoring to catch glimpses through\\nthe trees, of the flood of golden glory which formed a glittering halo\\naround the sun, tinging here and there with ruby streaks, or bordering\\nwith narrow edgings of shining yellow, a mass of clouds that lay piled\\nat no great distance above the western hills, Hawkeye turned suddenly,\\nand, pointing upwards towards the gorgeous heavens, he spoke:--\\n\\n\"Yonder is the signal given to a man to seek his food and natural rest,\"\\nhe said: \"better and wiser would it be, if he could understand the signs\\nof nature, and take a lesson from the fowls of the air and the beasts of\\nthe fields! Our night, however, will soon be over; for, with the moon,\\nwe must be up and moving again. I remember to have fou\\'t the Maquas,\\nhereaways, in the first war in which I ever drew blood from man; and we\\nthrew up a work of blocks, to keep the ravenous varmints from handling\\nour scalps. If my marks do not fail me, we shall find the place a few\\nrods farther to our left.\"\\n\\nWithout waiting for an assent, or, indeed, for any reply, the sturdy\\nhunter moved boldly into a dense thicket of young chestnuts, shoving\\naside the branches of the exuberant shoots which nearly covered the\\nground, like a man who expected, at each step, to discover some object\\nhe had formerly known. The recollection of the scout did not deceive\\nhim. After penetrating through the brush, matted as it was with briers,\\nfor a few hundred feet he entered an open space, that surrounded a low,\\ngreen hillock, which was crowned by the decayed block-house in question.\\nThis rude and neglected building was one of those deserted works, which,\\nhaving been thrown up on an emergency, had been abandoned with the\\ndisappearance of danger, and was now quietly crumbling in the solitude\\nof the forest, neglected, and nearly forgotten, like the circumstances\\nwhich had caused it to be reared. Such memorials of the passage and\\nstruggles of man are yet frequent throughout the broad barrier of\\nwilderness which once separated the hostile provinces, and form a\\nspecies of ruins that are intimately associated with the recollections\\nof colonial history, and which are in appropriate keeping with the\\ngloomy character of the surrounding scenery.[19] The roof of bark had\\nlong since fallen, and mingled with the soil; but the huge logs of pine,\\nwhich had been hastily thrown together, still preserved their relative\\npositions, though one angle of the work had given way under the\\npressure, and threatened a speedy downfall to the remainder of the\\nrustic edifice. While Heyward and his companions hesitated to approach a\\nbuilding so decayed, Hawkeye and the Indians entered within the low\\nwalls, not only without fear, but with obvious interest. While the\\nformer surveyed the ruins, both internally and externally, with the\\ncuriosity of one whose recollections were reviving at each moment,\\nChingachgook related to his son, in the language of the Delawares, and\\nwith the pride of a conqueror, the brief history of the skirmish which\\nhad been fought, in his youth, in that secluded spot. A strain of\\nmelancholy, however, blended with his triumph, rendering his voice, as\\nusual, soft and musical.\\n\\nIn the meantime, the sisters gladly dismounted, and prepared to enjoy\\ntheir halt in the coolness of the evening, and in a security which they\\nbelieved nothing but the beasts of the forest could invade.\\n\\n\"Would not our resting-place have been more retired, my worthy friend,\"\\ndemanded the more vigilant Duncan, perceiving that the scout had already\\nfinished his short survey, \"had we chosen a spot less known, and one\\nmore rarely visited than this?\"\\n\\n\"Few live who know the block-house was ever raised,\" was the slow and\\nmusing answer; \"\\'tis not often that books are made, and narratives\\nwritten, of such a scrimmage as was here fou\\'t atween the Mohicans and\\nthe Mohawks, in a war of their own waging. I was then a younker, and\\nwent out with the Delawares, because I know\\'d they were a scandalized\\nand wronged race. Forty days and forty nights did the imps crave our\\nblood around this pile of logs, which I designed and partly reared,\\nbeing, as you\\'ll remember, no Indian myself, but a man without a cross.\\nThe Delawares lent themselves to the work, and we made it good, ten to\\ntwenty, until our numbers were nearly equal, and then we sallied out\\nupon the hounds, and not a man of them ever got back to tell the fate of\\nhis party. Yes, yes; I was then young, and new to the sight of blood;\\nand not relishing the thought that creatures who had spirits like myself\\nshould lay on the naked ground, to be torn asunder by beasts, or to\\nbleach in the rains, I buried the dead with my own hands, under that\\nvery little hillock where you have placed yourselves; and no bad seat\\ndoes it make neither, though it be raised by the bones of mortal men.\"\\n\\nHeyward and the sisters arose, on the instant, from the grassy\\nsepulchre; nor could the two latter, notwithstanding the terrific scenes\\nthey had so recently passed through, entirely suppress an emotion of\\nnatural horror, when they found themselves in such familiar contact with\\nthe grave of the dead Mohawks. The gray light, the gloomy little area of\\ndark grass, surrounded by its border of brush, beyond which the pines\\nrose, in breathing silence, apparently, into the very clouds, and the\\ndeath-like stillness of the vast forest, were all in unison to deepen\\nsuch a sensation.\\n\\n\"They are gone, and they are harmless,\" continued Hawkeye, waving his\\nhand, with a melancholy smile, at their manifest alarm: \"they\\'ll never\\nshout the war-whoop nor strike a blow with the tomahawk again! And of\\nall those who aided in placing them where they lie, Chingachgook and I\\nonly are living! The brothers and family of the Mohican formed our\\nwar-party; and you see before you all that are now left of his race.\"\\n\\nThe eyes of the listeners involuntarily sought the forms of the Indians,\\nwith a compassionate interest in their desolate fortune. The dark\\npersons were still to be seen within the shadows of the block-house, the\\nson listening to the relation of his father with that sort of\\nintenseness which would be created by a narrative that redounded so much\\nto the honor of those whose names he had long revered for their courage\\nand savage virtues.\\n\\n\"I had thought the Delawares a pacific people,\" said Duncan, \"and that\\nthey never waged war in person; trusting the defence of their lands to\\nthose very Mohawks that you slew!\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis true in part,\" returned the scout, \"and yet, at the bottom, \\'tis a\\nwicked lie. Such a treaty was made in ages gone by, through the\\ndeviltries of the Dutchers, who wished to disarm the natives that had\\nthe best right to the country where they had settled themselves. The\\nMohicans, though a part of the same nation, having to deal with the\\nEnglish, never entered into the silly bargain, but kept to their\\nmanhood; as in truth did the Delawares, when their eyes were opened to\\ntheir folly. You see before you a chief of the great Mohican Sagamores!\\nOnce his family could chase their deer over tracts of country wider than\\nthat which belongs to the Albany Patteroon, without crossing brook or\\nhill that was not their own; but what is left to their descendant! He\\nmay find his six feet of earth when God chooses, and keep it in peace,\\nperhaps, if he has a friend who will take the pains to sink his head so\\nlow that the ploughshares cannot reach it!\"\\n\\n\"Enough!\" said Heyward, apprehensive that the subject might lead to a\\ndiscussion that would interrupt the harmony so necessary to the\\npreservation of his fair companions: \"we have journeyed far, and few\\namong us are blessed with forms like that of yours, which seems to know\\nneither fatigue nor weakness.\"\\n\\n\"The sinews and bones of a man carry me through it all,\" said the\\nhunter, surveying his muscular limbs with a simplicity that betrayed the\\nhonest pleasure the compliment afforded him: \"there are larger and\\nheavier men to be found in the settlements, but you might travel many\\ndays in a city before you could meet one able to walk fifty miles\\nwithout stopping to take breath, or who has kept the hounds within\\nhearing during a chase of hours. However, as flesh and blood are not\\nalways the same, it is quite reasonable to suppose that the gentle ones\\nare willing to rest, after all they have seen and done this day. Uncas,\\nclear out the spring, while your father and I make a cover for their\\ntender heads of these chestnut shoots, and a bed of grass and leaves.\"\\n\\nThe dialogue ceased, while the hunter and his companions busied\\nthemselves in preparations for the comfort and protection of those they\\nguided. A spring, which many long years before had induced the natives\\nto select the place for their temporary fortification, was soon cleared\\nof leaves, and a fountain of crystal gushed from the bed, diffusing its\\nwaters over the verdant hillock. A corner of the building was then\\nroofed in such a manner as to exclude the heavy dew of the climate, and\\npiles of sweet shrubs and dried leaves were laid beneath it for the\\nsisters to repose on.\\n\\nWhile the diligent woodsmen were employed in this manner, Cora and Alice\\npartook of that refreshment which duty required much more than\\ninclination prompted them to accept. They then retired within the walls,\\nand first offering up their thanksgivings for past mercies, and\\npetitioning for a continuance of the divine favor throughout the coming\\nnight, they laid their tender forms on the fragrant couch, and in spite\\nof recollections and forebodings, soon sank into those slumbers which\\nnature so imperiously demanded, and which were sweetened by hopes for\\nthe morrow. Duncan had prepared himself to pass the night in\\nwatchfulness near them, just without the ruin, but the scout, perceiving\\nhis intention, pointed towards Chingachgook, as he coolly disposed his\\nown person on the grass, and said--\\n\\n\"The eyes of a white man are too heavy and too blind for such a watch as\\nthis! The Mohican will be our sentinel, therefore let us sleep.\"\\n\\n\"I proved myself a sluggard on my post during the past night,\" said\\nHeyward, \"and have less need of repose than you, who did more credit to\\nthe character of a soldier. Let all the party seek their rest, then,\\nwhile I hold guard.\"\\n\\n\"If we lay among the white tents of the 60th, and in front of an enemy\\nlike the French, I could not ask for a better watchman,\" returned the\\nscout; \"but in the darkness and among the signs of the wilderness your\\njudgment would be like the folly of a child, and your vigilance thrown\\naway. Do then, like Uncas and myself, sleep, and sleep in safety.\"\\n\\nHeyward perceived, in truth, that the younger Indian had thrown his form\\non the side of the hillock while they were talking, like one who sought\\nto make the most of the time allotted to rest, and that his example had\\nbeen followed by David, whose voice literally \"clove to his jaws,\" with\\nthe fever of his wound, heightened, as it was, by their toilsome march.\\nUnwilling to prolong a useless discussion, the young man affected to\\ncomply, by posting his back against the logs of the block-house, in a\\nhalf-recumbent posture, though resolutely determined, in his own mind,\\nnot to close an eye until he had delivered his precious charge into the\\narms of Munro himself. Hawkeye, believing he had prevailed, soon fell\\nasleep, and a silence as deep as the solitude in which they had found\\nit, pervaded the retired spot.\\n\\nFor many minutes Duncan succeeded in keeping his senses on the alert,\\nand alive to every moaning sound that arose from the forest. His vision\\nbecame more acute as the shades of evening settled on the place; and\\neven after the stars were glimmering above his head, he was able to\\ndistinguish the recumbent forms of his companions, as they lay stretched\\non the grass, and to note the person of Chingachgook, who sat upright\\nand motionless as one of the trees which formed the dark barrier on\\nevery side. He still heard the gentle breathings of the sisters, who lay\\nwithin a few feet of him, and not a leaf was ruffled by the passing air,\\nof which his ear did not detect the whispering sound. At length,\\nhowever, the mournful notes of a whippoorwill became blended with the\\nmoanings of an owl; his heavy eyes occasionally sought the bright rays\\nof the stars, and then he fancied he saw them through the fallen lids.\\nAt instants of momentary wakefulness he mistook a bush for his associate\\nsentinel; his head next sank upon his shoulder, which, in its turn,\\nsought the support of the ground; and, finally, his whole person become\\nrelaxed and pliant, and the young man sank into a deep sleep, dreaming\\nthat he was a knight of ancient chivalry, holding his midnight vigils\\nbefore the tent of a recaptured princess, whose favor he did not despair\\nof gaining, by such a proof of devotion and watchfulness.\\n\\nHow long the tired Duncan lay in this insensible state he never knew\\nhimself, but his slumbering visions had been long lost in total\\nforgetfulness, when he was awakened by a light tap on the shoulder.\\nAroused by this signal, slight as it was, he sprang upon his feet with a\\nconfused recollection of the self-imposed duty he had assumed with the\\ncommencement of the night.\\n\\n\"Who comes?\" he demanded, feeling for his sword at the place where it\\nwas usually suspended, \"Speak! friend or enemy?\"\\n\\n\"Friend,\" replied the low voice of Chingachgook; who, pointing upwards\\nat the luminary which was shedding its mild light through the opening in\\nthe trees, directly in their bivouac, immediately added, in his rude\\nEnglish, \"moon comes, and white man\\'s fort far--far off; time to move,\\nwhen sleep shuts both eyes of the Frenchman!\"\\n\\n\"You say true! call up your friends, and bridle the horses, while I\\nprepare my own companions for the march!\"\\n\\n\"We are awake, Duncan,\" said the soft, silvery tones of Alice within the\\nbuilding, \"and ready to travel very fast after so refreshing a sleep;\\nbut you have watched through the tedious night in our behalf, after\\nhaving endured so much fatigue the live-long day!\"\\n\\n\"Say, rather, I would have watched, but my treacherous eyes betrayed me;\\ntwice have I proved myself unfit for the trust I bear.\"\\n\\n\"Nay, Duncan, deny it not,\" interrupted the smiling Alice, issuing from\\nthe shadows of the building into the light of the moon, in all the\\nloveliness of her freshened beauty; \"I know you to be a heedless one,\\nwhen self is the object of your care, and but too vigilant in favor of\\nothers. Can we not tarry here a little longer, while you find the rest\\nyou need? Cheerfully, most cheerfully, will Cora and I keep the vigils,\\nwhile you, and all these brave men, endeavor to snatch a little sleep!\"\\n\\n\"If shame could cure me of my drowsiness, I should never close an eye\\nagain,\" said the uneasy youth, gazing at the ingenuous countenance of\\nAlice, where, however, in its sweet solicitude, he read nothing to\\nconfirm his half awakened suspicion. \"It is but too true, that after\\nleading you into danger by my heedlessness, I have not even the merit of\\nguarding your pillows as should become a soldier.\"\\n\\n\"No one but Duncan himself should accuse Duncan of such a weakness. Go,\\nthen, and sleep; believe me, neither of us, weak girls as we are, will\\nbetray our watch.\"\\n\\nThe young man was relieved from the awkwardness of making any further\\nprotestations of his own demerits, by an exclamation from Chingachgook,\\nand the attitude of riveted attention assumed by his son.\\n\\n\"The Mohicans hear an enemy!\" whispered Hawkeye, who, by this time, in\\ncommon with the whole party, was awake and stirring. \"They scent danger\\nin the wind!\"\\n\\n\"God forbid!\" exclaimed Heyward. \"Surely we have had enough of\\nbloodshed!\"\\n\\nWhile he spoke, however, the young soldier seized his rifle, and\\nadvancing towards the front, prepared to atone for his venial\\nremissness, by freely exposing his life in defence of those he attended.\\n\\n\"\\'Tis some creature of the forest prowling around us in quest of food,\"\\nhe said, in a whisper, as soon as the low, and apparently distant\\nsounds, which had startled the Mohicans, reached his own ears.\\n\\n\"Hist!\" returned the attentive scout; \"\\'tis man; even I can now tell his\\ntread, poor as my senses are when compared to an Indian\\'s! That\\nscampering Huron has fallen in with one of Montcalm\\'s outlying parties,\\nand they have struck upon our trail. I shouldn\\'t like, myself, to spill\\nmore human blood in this spot,\" he added, looking around with anxiety in\\nhis features, at the dim objects by which he was surrounded; \"but what\\nmust be, must! Lead the horses into the block-house, Uncas; and,\\nfriends, do you follow to the same shelter. Poor and old as it is, it\\noffers a cover, and has rung with the crack of a rifle afore to-night!\"\\n\\nHe was instantly obeyed, the Mohicans leading the Narragansetts within\\nthe ruin, whither the whole party repaired with the most guarded\\nsilence.\\n\\nThe sounds of approaching footsteps were now too distinctly audible to\\nleave any doubts as to the nature of the interruption. They were soon\\nmingled with voices calling to each other in an Indian dialect, which\\nthe hunter, in a whisper, affirmed to Heyward was the language of the\\nHurons. When the party reached the point where the horses had entered\\nthe thicket which surrounded the block-house, they were evidently at\\nfault, having lost those marks which, until that moment, had directed\\ntheir pursuit.\\n\\nIt would seem by the voices that twenty men were soon collected at that\\none spot, mingling their different opinions and advice in noisy clamor.\\n\\n\"The knaves know our weakness,\" whispered Hawkeye, who stood by the side\\nof Heyward, in deep shade, looking through an opening in the logs, \"or\\nthey wouldn\\'t indulge their idleness in such a squaw\\'s march. Listen to\\nthe reptiles! each man among them seems to have two tongues, and but a\\nsingle leg.\"\\n\\nDuncan, brave as he was in the combat, could not, in such a moment of\\npainful suspense, make any reply to the cool and characteristic remark\\nof the scout. He only grasped his rifle more firmly, and fastened his\\neyes upon the narrow opening, through which he gazed upon the moonlight\\nview with increasing anxiety. The deeper tones of one who spoke as\\nhaving authority were next heard, amid a silence that denoted the\\nrespect with which his orders, or rather advice, was received. After\\nwhich, by the rustling of leaves, and cracking of dried twigs, it was\\napparent the savages were separating in pursuit of the lost trail.\\nFortunately for the pursued, the light of the moon, while it shed a\\nflood of mild lustre upon the little area around the ruin, was not\\nsufficiently strong to penetrate the deep arches of the forest, where\\nthe objects still lay in deceptive shadow. The search proved fruitless;\\nfor so short and sudden had been the passage from the faint path the\\ntravellers had journeyed into the thicket, that every trace of their\\nfootsteps was lost in the obscurity of the woods.\\n\\nIt was not long, however, before the restless savages were heard beating\\nthe brush, and gradually approaching the inner edge of that dense border\\nof young chestnuts which encircled the little area.\\n\\n\"They are coming,\" muttered Heyward, endeavoring to thrust his rifle\\nthrough the chink in the logs; \"let us fire on their approach.\"\\n\\n\"Keep everything in the shade,\" returned the scout; \"the snapping of a\\nflint, or even the smell of a single karnel of the brimstone, would\\nbring the hungry varlets upon us in a body. Should it please God that we\\nmust give battle for the scalps, trust to the experience of men who know\\nthe ways of the savages, and who are not often backward when the\\nwar-whoop is howled.\"\\n\\nDuncan cast his eyes behind him, and saw that the trembling sisters were\\ncowering in the far corner of the building, while the Mohicans stood in\\nthe shadow, like two upright posts, ready, and apparently willing, to\\nstrike when the blow should be needed. Curbing his impatience, he again\\nlooked out upon the area, and awaited the result in silence. At that\\ninstant the thicket opened, and a tall and armed Huron advanced a few\\npaces into the open space. As he gazed upon the silent block-house, the\\nmoon fell upon his swarthy countenance, and betrayed its surprise and\\ncuriosity. He made the exclamation which usually accompanies the former\\nemotion in an Indian, and, calling in a low voice, soon drew a companion\\nto his side.\\n\\nThese children of the woods stood together for several moments pointing\\nat the crumbling edifice, and conversing in the unintelligible language\\nof their tribe. They then approached, though with slow and cautious\\nsteps, pausing every instant to look at the building, like startled\\ndeer, whose curiosity struggled powerfully with their awakened\\napprehensions for the mastery. The foot of one of them suddenly rested\\non the mound, and he stooped to examine its nature. At this moment,\\nHeyward observed that the scout loosened his knife in his sheath, and\\nlowered the muzzle of his rifle. Imitating these movements, the young\\nman prepared himself for the struggle, which now seemed inevitable.\\n\\nThe savages were so near, that the least motion in one of the horses, or\\neven a breath louder than common, would have betrayed the fugitives.\\nBut, in discovering the character of the mound, the attention of the\\nHurons appeared directed to a different object. They spoke together, and\\nthe sounds of their voices were low and solemn, as if influenced by a\\nreverence that was deeply blended with awe. Then they drew warily back,\\nkeeping their eyes riveted on the ruin, as if they expected to see the\\napparitions of the dead issue from its silent walls, until having\\nreached the boundary of the area, they moved slowly into the thicket,\\nand disappeared.\\n\\nHawkeye dropped the breech of his rifle to the earth, and drawing a\\nlong, free breath, exclaimed, in an audible whisper,--\\n\\n\"Ay! they respect the dead, and it has this time saved their own lives,\\nand, it may be, the lives of better men too.\"\\n\\nHeyward lent his attention for a single moment to his companion, but\\nwithout replying, he again turned towards those who just then interested\\nhim more. He heard the two Hurons leave the bushes, and it was soon\\nplain that all the pursuers were gathered about them, in deep attention\\nto their report. After a few minutes of earnest and solemn dialogue,\\naltogether different from the noisy clamor with which they had first\\ncollected about the spot, the sounds grew fainter and more distant, and\\nfinally were lost in the depths of the forest.\\n\\nHawkeye waited until a signal from the listening Chingachgook assured\\nhim that every sound from the retiring party was completely swallowed by\\nthe distance, when he motioned to Heyward to lead forth the horses, and\\nto assist the sisters into their saddles. The instant this was done,\\nthey issued through the broken gateway, and stealing out by a direction\\nopposite to the one by which they had entered, they quitted the spot,\\nthe sisters casting furtive glances at the silent grave and crumbling\\nruin, as they left the soft light of the moon, to bury themselves in the\\ngloom of the woods.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \"_Guard._--Qui est la?\\n\\n  _Puc._--Paisans, pauvres gens de France.\"\\n\\n  _King Henry VI._\\n\\n\\nDuring the rapid movement from the block-house, and until the party was\\ndeeply buried in the forest, each individual was too much interested in\\nthe escape to hazard a word even in whispers. The scout resumed his post\\nin the advance, though his steps, after he had thrown a safe distance\\nbetween himself and his enemies, were more deliberate than in their\\nprevious march, in consequence of his utter ignorance of the localities\\nof the surrounding woods. More than once he halted to consult with his\\nconfederates, the Mohicans, pointing upwards at the moon, and examining\\nthe barks of the trees with care. In these brief pauses, Heyward and the\\nsisters listened, with senses rendered doubly acute by the danger, to\\ndetect any symptoms which might announce the proximity of their foes. At\\nsuch moments, it seemed as if a vast range of country lay buried in\\neternal sleep; not the least sound arising from the forest, unless it\\nwas the distant and scarcely audible rippling of a water-course. Birds,\\nbeasts, and man, appeared to slumber alike, if, indeed, any of the\\nlatter were to be found in that wide tract of wilderness. But the sounds\\nof the rivulet, feeble and murmuring as they were, relieved the guides\\nat once from no trifling embarrassment, and towards it they immediately\\nheld their way.\\n\\nWhen the banks of the little stream were gained, Hawkeye made another\\nhalt; and, taking the moccasins from his feet, he invited Heyward and\\nGamut to follow his example. He then entered the water, and for near an\\nhour they travelled in the bed of the brook, leaving no trail. The moon\\nhad already sunk into an immense pile of black clouds, which lay\\nimpending above the western horizon, when they issued from the low and\\ndevious water-course to rise again to the light and level of the sandy\\nbut wooded plain. Here the scout seemed to be once more at home, for he\\nheld on his way with the certainty and diligence of a man who moved in\\nthe security of his own knowledge. The path soon became more uneven, and\\nthe travellers could plainly perceive that the mountains drew nigher to\\nthem on each hand, and that they were, in truth, about entering one of\\ntheir gorges. Suddenly, Hawkeye made a pause, and waiting until he was\\njoined by the whole party, he spoke, though in tones so low and\\ncautious, that they added to the solemnity of his words, in the quiet\\nand darkness of the place.\\n\\n\"It is easy to know the pathways, and to find the licks and\\nwater-courses of the wilderness,\" he said; \"but who that saw this spot\\ncould venture to say, that a mighty army was at rest among yonder silent\\ntrees and barren mountains?\"\\n\\n\"We are then at no great distance from William Henry?\" said Heyward,\\nadvancing nigher to the scout.\\n\\n\"It is yet a long and weary path, and when and where to strike it, is\\nnow our greatest difficulty. See,\" he said, pointing through the trees\\ntowards a spot where a little basin of water reflected the stars from\\nits placid bosom, \"here is the \\'bloody pond\\'; and I am on the ground\\nthat I have not only often travelled, but over which I have fou\\'t the\\nenemy, from the rising to the setting sun.\"\\n\\n\"Ha! that sheet of dull and dreary water, then, is the sepulchre of the\\nbrave men who fell in the contest. I have heard it named, but never have\\nI stood on its banks before.\"\\n\\n\"Three battles did we make with the Dutch-Frenchman[20] in a day,\"\\ncontinued Hawkeye, pursuing the train of his own thoughts, rather than\\nreplying to the remark of Duncan. \"He met us hard by, in our outward\\nmarch to ambush his advance, and scattered us, like driven deer, through\\nthe defile, to the shores of Horican. Then we rallied behind our fallen\\ntrees, and made head against him, under Sir William--who was made Sir\\nWilliam for that very deed; and well did we pay him for the disgrace of\\nthe morning! Hundreds of Frenchmen saw the sun that day for the last\\ntime; and even the leader, Dieskau himself, fell into our hands so cut\\nand torn with the lead, that he has gone back to his own country, unfit\\nfor further acts in war.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Twas a noble repulse!\" exclaimed Heyward, in the heat of his youthful\\nardor; \"the fame of it reached us early, in our southern army.\"\\n\\n\"Ay! but it did not end there. I was sent by Major Effingham, at Sir\\nWilliam\\'s own bidding, to outflank the French, and carry the tidings of\\ntheir disaster across the portage, to the fort on the Hudson. Just\\nhereaway, where you see the trees rise into a mountain swell, I met a\\nparty coming down to our aid, and I led them where the enemy were taking\\ntheir meal, little dreaming that they had not finished the bloody work\\nof the day.\"\\n\\n\"And you surprised them?\"\\n\\n\"If death can be a surprise to men who are thinking only of the cravings\\nof their appetites. We gave them but little breathing time, for they had\\nborne hard upon us in the fight of the morning, and there were few in\\nour party who had not lost friend or relative by their hands. When all\\nwas over, the dead, and some say the dying, were cast into that little\\npond. These eyes have seen its waters colored with blood, as natural\\nwater never yet flowed from the bowels of the \\'arth.\"\\n\\n\"It was a convenient, and, I trust, will prove a peaceful grave for a\\nsoldier. You have, then, seen much service on this frontier?\"\\n\\n\"I!\" said the scout, erecting his tall person with an air of military\\npride; \"there are not many echoes among these hills that haven\\'t rung\\nwith the crack of my rifle, nor is there the space of a square mile\\natwixt Horican and the river, that \\'Killdeer\\' hasn\\'t dropped a living\\nbody on, be it an enemy or be it a brute beast. As for the grave, there,\\nbeing as quiet as you mention, it is another matter. There are them in\\nthe camp who say and think, man, to lie still, should not be buried\\nwhile the breath is in the body; and certain it is that in the hurry of\\nthat evening, the doctors had but little time to say who was living and\\nwho was dead. Hist! see you nothing walking on the shore of the pond?\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis not probable that any are as houseless as ourselves, in this\\ndreary forest.\"\\n\\n\"Such as he may care but little for house or shelter, and night dew can\\nnever wet a body that passes its days in the water,\" returned the scout,\\ngrasping the shoulder of Heyward with such convulsive strength as to\\nmake the young soldier painfully sensible how much superstitious terror\\nhad got the mastery of a man usually so dauntless.\\n\\n\"By heaven! there is a human form, and it approaches! Stand to your\\narms, my friends; for we know not whom we encounter.\"\\n\\n\"Qui vive?\" demanded a stern, quick voice, which sounded like a\\nchallenge from another world, issuing out of that solitary and solemn\\nplace.\\n\\n\"What says it?\" whispered the scout; \"it speaks neither Indian nor\\nEnglish!\"\\n\\n\"Qui vive?\" repeated the same voice, which was quickly followed by the\\nrattling of arms, and a menacing attitude.\\n\\n\"France!\" cried Heyward, advancing from the shadow of the trees to the\\nshore of the pond, within a few yards of the sentinel.\\n\\n\"D\\'ou venez-vous--ou allez-vous, d\\'aussi bonne heure?\" demanded the\\ngrenadier, in the language and with the accent of a man from old France.\\n\\n\"Je viens de la decouverte, et je vais me coucher.\"\\n\\n\"Etes-vous officier du roi?\"\\n\\n\"Sans doute, mon camarade; me prends-tu pour un provincial! Je suis\\ncapitaine de chasseurs (Heyward well knew that the other was of a\\nregiment in the line); j\\'ai ici, avec moi, les filles du commandant de\\nla fortification. Aha! tu en as entendu parler! je les ai fait\\nprisonnieres pres de l\\'autre fort, et je les conduis au general.\"\\n\\n\"Ma foi! mesdames; j\\'en suis fache pour vous,\" exclaimed the young\\nsoldier, touching his cap with grace; \"mais--fortune de guerre! vous\\ntrouverez notre general un brave homme, et bien poli avec les dames.\"\\n\\n\"C\\'est le caractere des gens de guerre,\" said Cora, with admirable\\nself-possession. \"Adieu, mon ami; je vous souhaiterais un devoir plus\\nagreable a remplir.\"\\n\\nThe soldier made a low and humble acknowledgment for her civility; and\\nHeyward adding a \"Bonne nuit, mon camarade,\" they moved deliberately\\nforward, leaving the sentinel pacing the banks of the silent pond,\\nlittle suspecting an enemy of so much effrontery, and humming to himself\\nthose words, which were recalled to his mind by the sight of women, and\\nperhaps by recollections of his own distant and beautiful France--\\n\\n  \"Vive le vin, l\\'amour,\" etc., etc.\\n\\n\"\\'Tis well you understood the knave!\" whispered the scout, when they had\\ngained a little distance from the place, and letting his rifle fall into\\nthe hollow of his arm again; \"I soon saw that he was one of them uneasy\\nFrenchers; and well for him it was that his speech was friendly and his\\nwishes kind, or a place might have been found for his bones among those\\nof his countrymen.\"\\n\\nHe was interrupted by a long and heavy groan which arose from the little\\nbasin, as though, in truth, the spirits of the departed lingered about\\ntheir watery sepulchre.\\n\\n\"Surely it was of flesh!\" continued the scout; \"no spirit could handle\\nits arms so steadily!\"\\n\\n\"It _was_ of flesh; but whether the poor fellow still belongs to this\\nworld may well be doubted,\" said Heyward, glancing his eyes around him,\\nand missing Chingachgook from their little band. Another groan more\\nfaint than the former, was succeeded by a heavy and sullen plunge into\\nthe water, and all was as still again as if the borders of the dreary\\npool had never been awakened from the silence of creation. While they\\nyet hesitated in uncertainty, the form of the Indian was seen gliding\\nout of the thicket. As the chief rejoined them, with one hand he\\nattached the reeking scalp of the unfortunate young Frenchman to his\\ngirdle, and with the other he replaced the knife and tomahawk that had\\ndrunk his blood. He then took his wonted station, with the air of a man\\nwho believed he had done a deed of merit.\\n\\nThe scout dropped one end of his rifle to the earth, and leaning his\\nhands on the other, he stood musing in profound silence. Then shaking\\nhis head in a mournful manner, he muttered,--\\n\\n\"\\'T would have been a cruel and an unhuman act for a white-skin; but\\n\\'tis the gift and natur\\' of an Indian, and I suppose it should not be\\ndenied. I could wish, though, it had befallen an accursed Mingo, rather\\nthan that gay young boy from the old countries.\"\\n\\n\"Enough!\" said Heyward, apprehensive the unconscious sisters might\\ncomprehend the nature of the detention, and conquering his disgust by a\\ntrain of reflections very much like that of the hunter; \"\\'tis done; and\\nthough better it were left undone, cannot be amended. You see we are,\\ntoo obviously, within the sentinels of the enemy; what course do you\\npropose to follow?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Hawkeye, rousing himself again, \"\\'tis as you say, too late\\nto harbor further thoughts about it. Ay, the French have gathered around\\nthe fort in good earnest, and we have a delicate needle to thread in\\npassing them.\"\\n\\n\"And but little time to do it in,\" added Heyward, glancing his eyes\\nupward, toward the bank of vapor that concealed the setting moon.\\n\\n\"And little time to do it in!\" repeated the scout. \"The thing may be\\ndone in two fashions, by the help of Providence, without which it may\\nnot be done at all.\"\\n\\n\"Name them quickly, for time presses.\"\\n\\n\"One would be to dismount the gentle ones, and let their beasts range\\nthe plain; by sending the Mohicans in front, we might then cut a lane\\nthrough their sentries, and enter the fort over the dead bodies.\"\\n\\n\"It will not do--it will not do!\" interrupted the generous Heyward; \"a\\nsoldier might force his way in this manner, but never with such a\\nconvoy.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Twould be, indeed, a bloody path for tender feet to wade in,\" returned\\nthe equally reluctant scout; \"but I thought it befitting my manhood to\\nname it. We must then turn on our trail and get without the line of\\ntheir look-outs, when we will bend short to the west, and enter the\\nmountains; where I can hide you, so that all the devil\\'s hounds in\\nMontcalm\\'s pay would be thrown off the scent, for months to come.\"\\n\\n\"Let it be done, and that instantly.\"\\n\\nFurther words were unnecessary; for Hawkeye, merely uttering the mandate\\nto \"follow,\" moved along the route by which they had just entered their\\npresent critical and even dangerous situation. Their progress, like\\ntheir late dialogue, was guarded, and without noise; for none knew at\\nwhat moment a passing patrol, or a crouching picket of the enemy, might\\nrise upon their path. As they held their silent way along the margin of\\nthe pond, again Heyward and the scout stole furtive glances at its\\nappalling dreariness. They looked in vain for the form they had so\\nrecently seen stalking along its silent shores, while a low and regular\\nwash of the little waves, by announcing that the waters were not yet\\nsubsided, furnished a frightful memorial of the deed of blood they had\\njust witnessed. Like all that passing and gloomy scene, the low basin,\\nhowever, quickly melted in the darkness, and became blended with the\\nmass of black objects in the rear of the travellers.\\n\\nHawkeye soon deviated from the line of their retreat, and striking off\\ntowards the mountains which form the western boundary of the narrow\\nplain, he led his followers, with swift steps, deep within the shadows\\nthat were cast from their high and broken summits. The route was now\\npainful; lying over ground ragged with rocks, and intersected with\\nravines, and their progress proportionately slow. Bleak and black hills\\nlay on every side of them, compensating in some degree for the\\nadditional toil of the march, by the sense of security they imparted. At\\nlength the party began slowly to climb a steep and rugged ascent by a\\npath that curiously wound among rocks and trees, avoiding the one, and\\nsupported by the other, in a manner that showed it had been devised by\\nmen long practised in the arts of the wilderness. As they gradually rose\\nfrom the level of the valleys, the thick darkness which usually precedes\\nthe approach of day began to disperse, and objects were seen in the\\nplain and palpable colors with which they had been gifted by nature.\\nWhen they issued from the stunted woods which clung to the barren sides\\nof the mountain, upon a flat and mossy rock that formed its summit, they\\nmet the morning, as it came blushing above the green pines of a hill\\nthat lay on the opposite side of the valley of the Horican.\\n\\nThe scout now told the sisters to dismount; and taking the bridles from\\nthe mouths, and the saddles off the backs of the jaded beasts, he turned\\nthem loose, to glean a scanty subsistence among the shrubs and meagre\\nherbage of that elevated region.\\n\\n\"Go,\" he said, \"and seek your food where natur\\' gives it you; and beware\\nthat you become not food to ravenous wolves yourselves, among these\\nhills.\"\\n\\n\"Have we no further need of them?\" demanded Heyward.\\n\\n\"See, and judge with your own eyes,\" said the scout, advancing towards\\nthe eastern brow of the mountain, whither he beckoned for the whole\\nparty to follow; \"if it was as easy to look into the heart of man as it\\nis to spy out the nakedness of Montcalm\\'s camp from this spot,\\nhypocrites would grow scarce, and the cunning of a Mingo might prove a\\nlosing game, compared to the honesty of a Delaware.\"\\n\\nWhen the travellers reached the verge of the precipice, they saw, at a\\nglance, the truth of the scout\\'s declaration, and the admirable\\nforesight with which he had led them to their commanding station.\\n\\nThe mountain on which they stood, elevated, perhaps, a thousand feet in\\nthe air, was a high cone that rose a little in advance of that range\\nwhich stretches for miles along the western shores of the lake, until\\nmeeting its sister piles, beyond the water, it ran off towards the\\nCanadas, in confused and broken masses of rock, thinly sprinkled with\\nevergreens. Immediately at the feet of the party, the southern shore of\\nthe Horican swept in a broad semicircle, from mountain to mountain,\\nmarking a wide strand, that soon rose into an uneven and somewhat\\nelevated plain. To the north stretched the limpid, and, as it appeared\\nfrom that dizzy height, the narrow sheet of the \"holy lake,\" indented\\nwith numberless bays, embellished by fantastic headlands, and dotted\\nwith countless islands. At the distance of a few leagues, the bed of the\\nwaters became lost among mountains, or was wrapped in the masses of\\nvapor that came slowly rolling along their bosom, before a light morning\\nair. But a narrow opening between the crests of the hills pointed out\\nthe passage by which they found their way still farther north, to spread\\ntheir pure and ample sheets again, before pouring out their tribute into\\nthe distant Champlain. To the south stretched the defile, or rather\\nbroken plain, so often mentioned. For several miles in this direction,\\nthe mountains appeared reluctant to yield their dominion, but within\\nreach of the eye they diverged, and finally melted into the level and\\nsandy lands, across which we have accompanied our adventurers in their\\ndouble journey. Along both ranges of hills, which bounded the opposite\\nsides of the lake and valley, clouds of light vapor were rising in\\nspiral wreaths from the uninhabited woods, looking like the smokes of\\nhidden cottages; or rolled lazily down the declivities, to mingle with\\nthe fogs of the lower land. A single, solitary, snow-white cloud floated\\nabove the valley, and marked the spot beneath which lay the silent pool\\nof the \"bloody pond.\"\\n\\nDirectly on the shore of the lake, and nearer to its western than to its\\neastern margin, lay the extensive earthen ramparts and low buildings of\\nWilliam Henry. Two of the sweeping bastions appeared to rest on the\\nwater which washed their bases, while a deep ditch and extensive\\nmorasses guarded its other sides and angles. The land had been cleared\\nof wood for a reasonable distance around the work, but every other part\\nof the scene lay in the green livery of nature, except where the limpid\\nwater mellowed the view, or the bold rocks thrust their black and naked\\nheads above the undulating outline of the mountain ranges. In its front\\nmight be seen the scattered sentinels, who held a weary watch against\\ntheir numerous foes; and within the walls themselves, the travellers\\nlooked down upon men still drowsy with a night of vigilance. Towards the\\nsoutheast, but in immediate contact with the fort, was an entrenched\\ncamp, posted on a rocky eminence, that would have been far more eligible\\nfor the work itself, in which Hawkeye pointed out the presence of those\\nauxiliary regiments that had so recently left the Hudson in their\\ncompany. From the woods, a little farther to the south, rose numerous\\ndark and lurid smokes, that were easily to be distinguished from the\\npurer exhalations of the springs, and which the scout also showed to\\nHeyward, as evidences that the enemy lay in force in that direction.\\n\\nBut the spectacle which most concerned the young soldier was on the\\nwestern bank of the lake, though quite near to its southern termination.\\nOn a strip of land, which appeared, from his stand, too narrow to\\ncontain such an army, but which, in truth, extended many hundreds of\\nyards from the shores of the Horican to the base of the mountain, were\\nto be seen the white tents and military engines of an encampment of ten\\nthousand men. Batteries were already thrown up in their front, and even\\nwhile the spectators above them were looking down, with such different\\nemotions, on a scene which lay like a map beneath their feet, the roar\\nof artillery rose from the valley, and passed off in thundering echoes,\\nalong the eastern hills.\\n\\n\"Morning is just touching them below,\" said the deliberate and musing\\nscout, \"and the watchers have a mind to wake up the sleepers by the\\nsound of cannon. We are a few hours too late? Montcalm has already\\nfilled the woods with his accursed Iroquois.\"\\n\\n\"The place is, indeed, invested,\" returned Duncan, \"but is there no\\nexpedient by which we may enter? capture in the works would be far\\npreferable to falling again into the hands of roving Indians.\"\\n\\n\"See!\" exclaimed the scout, unconsciously directing the attention of\\nCora to the quarters of her own father, \"how that shot has made the\\nstones fly from the side of the commandant\\'s house! Ay! these Frenchers\\nwill pull it to pieces faster than it was put together, solid and thick\\nthough it be.\"\\n\\n\"Heyward, I sicken at the sight of danger that I cannot share,\" said the\\nundaunted, but anxious daughter. \"Let us go to Montcalm, and demand\\nadmission: he dare not deny a child the boon.\"\\n\\n\"You would scarce find the tent of the Frenchman with the hair on your\\nhead,\" said the blunt scout. \"If I had but one of the thousand boats\\nwhich lie empty along that shore, it might be done. Ha! here will soon\\nbe an end of the firing, for yonder comes a fog that will turn day to\\nnight, and make an Indian arrow more dangerous than a moulded cannon.\\nNow, if you are equal to the work, and will follow, I will make a push;\\nfor I long to get down into that camp, if it be only to scatter some\\nMingo dogs that I see lurking in the skirts of yonder thicket of birch.\"\\n\\n\"We are equal,\" said Cora, firmly: \"on such an errand we will follow to\\nany danger.\"\\n\\nThe scout turned to her with a smile of honest and cordial approbation\\nas he answered,--\\n\\n\"I would I had a thousand men, of brawny limbs and quick eyes, that\\nfeared death as little as you! I\\'d send them jabbering Frenchers back\\ninto their den again, afore the week was ended, howling like so many\\nfettered hounds or hungry wolves. But stir,\" he added, turning from her\\nto the rest of the party, \"the fog comes rolling down so fast, we shall\\nhave but just the time to meet it on the plain, and use it as a cover.\\nRemember, if any accident should befall me, to keep the air blowing on\\nyour left cheeks--or rather, follow the Mohicans; they\\'d scent their\\nway, be it in day or be it at night.\"\\n\\nHe then waved his hand for them to follow, and threw himself down the\\nsteep declivity, with free, but careful footsteps. Heyward assisted the\\nsisters to descend, and in a few minutes they were all far down a\\nmountain whose sides they had climbed with so much toil and pain.\\n\\nThe direction taken by Hawkeye soon brought the travellers to the level\\nof the plain, nearly opposite to a sally-port in the western curtain of\\nthe fort, which lay, itself, at the distance of about half a mile from\\nthe point where he halted to allow Duncan to come up with his charge. In\\ntheir eagerness, and favored by the nature of the ground, they had\\nanticipated the fog, which was rolling heavily down the lake, and it\\nbecame necessary to pause, until the mists had wrapped the camp of the\\nenemy in their fleecy mantle. The Mohicans profited by the delay, to\\nsteal out of the woods, and to make a survey of surrounding objects.\\nThey were followed at a little distance by the scout, with a view to\\nprofit early by their report, and to obtain some faint knowledge for\\nhimself of the more immediate localities.\\n\\nIn a very few moments he returned, his face reddened with vexation,\\nwhile he muttered his disappointment in words of no very gentle import.\\n\\n\"Here has the cunning Frenchman been posting a picket directly in our\\npath,\" he said; \"redskins and whites; and we shall be as likely to fall\\ninto their midst as to pass them in the fog!\"\\n\\n\"Cannot we make a circuit to avoid the danger,\" asked Heyward, \"and come\\ninto our path again when it is passed?\"\\n\\n\"Who that once bends from the line of his march in a fog can tell when\\nor how to turn to find it again! The mists of Horican are not like the\\ncurls from a peace-pipe, or the smoke which settles above a mosquito\\nfire.\"\\n\\nHe was yet speaking, when a crashing sound was heard, and a cannon-ball\\nentered the thicket, striking the body of a sapling, and rebounding to\\nthe earth, its force being much expended by previous resistance. The\\nIndians followed instantly like busy attendants on the terrible\\nmessenger, and Uncas commenced speaking earnestly and with much action,\\nin the Delaware tongue.\\n\\n\"It may be so, lad,\" muttered the scout, when he had ended; \"for\\ndesperate fevers are not to be treated like a toothache. Come, then, the\\nfog is shutting in.\"\\n\\n\"Stop!\" cried Heyward; \"first explain your expectations.\"\\n\\n\"\\'Tis soon done, and a small hope it is; but it is better than nothing.\\nThis shot that you see,\" added the scout, kicking the harmless iron with\\nhis foot, \"has ploughed the \\'arth in its road from the fort, and we\\nshall hunt for the furrow it has made, when all other signs may fail. No\\nmore words, but follow, or the fog may leave us in the middle of our\\npath, a mark for both armies to shoot at.\"\\n\\nHeyward perceiving that, in fact, a crisis had arrived when acts were\\nmore required than words, placed himself between the sisters, and drew\\nthem swiftly forward, keeping the dim figure of their leader in his eye.\\nIt was soon apparent that Hawkeye had not magnified the power of the\\nfog, for before they had proceeded twenty yards, it was difficult for\\nthe different individuals of the party to distinguish each other, in the\\nvapor.\\n\\nThey had made their little circuit to the left, and were already\\ninclining again towards the right, having, as Heyward thought, got over\\nnearly half the distance to the friendly works, when his ears were\\nsaluted with the fierce summons, apparently within twenty feet of them,\\nof--\\n\\n\"Qui va la?\"\\n\\n\"Push on!\" whispered the scout, once more bending to the left.\\n\\n\"Push on!\" repeated Heyward; when the summons was renewed by a dozen\\nvoices, each of which seemed charged with menace.\\n\\n\"C\\'est moi,\" cried Duncan, dragging, rather than leading those he\\nsupported, swiftly onward.\\n\\n\"Bete!--qui?--moi!\"\\n\\n\"Ami de la France.\"\\n\\n\"Tu m\\'as plus l\\'air d\\'un _ennemi_ de la France; arrete! ou pardieu je te\\nferai ami du diable. Non! feu, camarades, feu!\"\\n\\nThe order was instantly obeyed, and the fog was stirred by the explosion\\nof fifty muskets. Happily, the aim was bad, and the bullets cut the air\\nin a direction a little different from that taken by the fugitives;\\nthough still so nigh them, that to the unpractised ears of David and the\\ntwo females, it appeared as if they whistled within a few inches of the\\norgans. The outcry was renewed, and the order, not only to fire again,\\nbut to pursue, was too plainly audible. When Heyward briefly explained\\nthe meaning of the words they heard, Hawkeye halted, and spoke with\\nquick decision and great firmness.\\n\\n\"Let us deliver our fire,\" he said; \"they will believe it a sortie, and\\ngive way, or they will wait for reinforcements.\"\\n\\nThe scheme was well conceived, but failed in its effect. The instant the\\nFrench heard the pieces, it seemed as if the plain was alive with men,\\nmuskets rattling along its whole extent, from the shores of the lake to\\nthe farthest boundary of the woods.\\n\\n\"We shall draw their entire army upon us, and bring on a general\\nassault,\" said Duncan: \"lead on, my friend, for your own life, and\\nours.\"\\n\\nThe scout seemed willing to comply; but, in the hurry of the moment, and\\nin the change of position, he had lost the direction. In vain he turned\\neither cheek towards the light air; they felt equally cool. In this\\ndilemma, Uncas lighted on the furrow of the cannon-ball, where it had\\ncut the ground in three adjacent ant-hills.\\n\\n\"Give me the range!\" said Hawkeye, bending to catch a glimpse of the\\ndirection, and then instantly moving onward.\\n\\nCries, oaths, voices calling to each other, and the reports of muskets,\\nwere now quick and incessant, and, apparently, on every side of them.\\nSuddenly, a strong glare of light flashed across the scene, the fog\\nrolled upwards in thick wreaths, and several cannon belched across the\\nplain, and the roar was thrown heavily back from the bellowing echoes of\\nthe mountain.\\n\\n\"\\'Tis from the fort!\" exclaimed Hawkeye, turning short on his tracks;\\n\"and we, like stricken fools, were rushing to the woods, under the very\\nknives of the Maquas.\"\\n\\nThe instant their mistake was rectified, the whole party retraced the\\nerror with the utmost diligence. Duncan willingly relinquished the\\nsupport of Cora to the arm of Uncas, and Cora as readily accepted the\\nwelcome assistance. Men, hot and angry in pursuit, were evidently on\\ntheir footsteps, and each instant threatened their capture, if not their\\ndestruction.\\n\\n\"Point de quartier aux coquins!\" cried an eager pursuer, who seemed to\\ndirect the operations of the enemy.\\n\\n\"Stand firm, and be ready, my gallant 60ths!\" suddenly exclaimed a voice\\nabove them; \"wait to see the enemy,--fire low, and sweep the glacis.\"\\n\\n\"Father! father!\" exclaimed a piercing cry from out the mist; \"it is I!\\nAlice! thy own Elsie! spare, O! save your daughters!\"\\n\\n\"Hold!\" shouted the former speaker, in the awful tones of parental\\nagony, the sound reaching even to the woods, and rolling back in solemn\\necho. \"\\'Tis she! God has restored me my children! Throw open the\\nsally-port; to the field, 60ths, to the field; pull not a trigger, lest\\nye kill my lambs! Drive off these dogs of France with your steel.\"\\n\\nDuncan heard the grating of the rusty hinges, and darting to the spot,\\ndirected by the sound, he met a long line of dark red warriors, passing\\nswiftly towards the glacis. He knew them for his own battalion of the\\nroyal Americans, and flying to their head, soon swept every trace of his\\npursuers from before the works.\\n\\nFor an instant, Cora and Alice had stood trembling and bewildered by\\nthis unexpected desertion; but, before either had leisure for speech, or\\neven thought, an officer of gigantic frame whose locks were bleached\\nwith years and service, but whose air of military grandeur had been\\nrather softened than destroyed by time, rushed out of the body of the\\nmist, and folded them to his bosom, while large scalding tears rolled\\ndown his pale and wrinkled cheeks, and he exclaimed, in the peculiar\\naccent of Scotland,--\\n\\n\"For this I thank thee, Lord! Let danger come as it will, thy servant is\\nnow prepared!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "   'summary_text': 'Now that the afternoon is shortening, Hawkeye leads the party many toilsome miles to an open space surrounding a low, green hillock crowned by a rude, decayed block-house, the scene of a victorious youthful battle for Chingachgook and the scout. Under the hillock are the long-dead Mohawks, the memory of whom makes Hawkeye once again refer to the two Mohicans as the last of their tribe. All except Chingachgook fall asleep and awaken at the rising of the moon to continue their journey. Before they can leave, they hear the steps of some twenty enemy Indians who have apparently lost their trail. While the protagonists wait in quiet suspense, two Hurons approach the mound but warily withdraw out of respect for the dead. As soon as the sounds of the hunters completely fade away, the seven fugitives silently head north again. After tactically walking barefoot in a stream for an hour, they turn again to the plain and reach the \"bloody pond,\" where in a previous battle Frenchmen had been surprised, slain, and tossed into the water. Being now near the French outposts, they encounter a French sentinel, whom Heyward fools by answering in French and whom Chingachgook slips upon, kills, and scalps. Since they must turn back for safety, Hawkeye leads them up a mountain from which, as morning comes, they can see to the east Fort William Henry on the southern tip of Lake George. Between them and the fort are General Montcalm\\'s ten thousand Frenchmen, while to the southeast is the camped detachment from Fort Edward. Firing has already started, but as a great fog descends, the party plans to push through it to the fort. They have strayed from their way when a cannon ball from the fort rolls to a stop near them and they decide to follow its furrow to safety. Again running into French forces, they have to flee and become lost until Uncas finds the furrow again. They are hotly pursued, but within minutes they are beneath the walls of the fort, where Munro recognizes the voice of Alice and orders his men out the sally-port. Led by Heyward, the English disperse the French as the gigantic, grey-haired Munro, large tears rolling down his cheeks, embraces his two daughters in his arms.',\n",
       "   'summary_analysis': 'The story has now reached the end of the first long chase, during which one pattern of pursuit-capture-escape-and-pursuit is completed. But Cooper has made sure that the present safety for the main characters is only relative. He has made the reader aware that the defending English are far outnumbered and contained by the ten thousand French and their Indian allies; even the sentimental reader who may feel relief and a gush of emotional release at the reunion of the father and daughters knows that the protagonists now face the double danger of foes and can no longer maneuver as they did in the forests. If any lull is to come, it will be in terms of action, not suspense. The action here is so intense that little individual characterization is presented. Gamut is barely present, and Uncas apparently has no chance to show his interest in Cora. At one point Hawkeye relates some of the history of the tribe of Mohicans, and his reference to his two companions keeps alive the background theme of tribal demise. But rather than its setting him apart as an individual, Chingachgook\\'s taking of scalps merely shows how much he still has in common with all other Indians, though his actions do stand in contrast to Uncas\\' behavior in the preceding chapter. Hawkeye, who sees Chingachgook\\'s actions as part of his Indian \"gift,\" evinces one new character element with his superstition at the \"bloody pond.\" However, since Cooper is busy rounding out his action, he does not dwell on theme or characterization in these moments.',\n",

       "'\\n  \"Mine ear is open, and my heart prepared:\\n  The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold:\\n  Say, is my kingdom lost?\"\\n\\n  SHAKESPEARE.\\n\\n\\nIt was a feature peculiar to the colonial wars of North America, that\\nthe toils and dangers of the wilderness were to be encountered before\\nthe adverse hosts could meet. A wide and apparently an impervious\\nboundary of forests severed the possessions of the hostile provinces of\\nFrance and England. The hardy colonist, and the trained European who\\nfought at his side, frequently expended months in struggling against the\\nrapids of the streams, or in effecting the rugged passes of the\\nmountains, in quest of an opportunity to exhibit their courage in a more\\nmartial conflict. But, emulating the patience and self-denial of the\\npractised native warriors, they learned to overcome every difficulty;\\nand it would seem that, in time, there was no recess of the woods so\\ndark, nor any secret place so lovely, that it might claim exemption from\\nthe inroads of those who had pledged their blood to satiate their\\nvengeance, or to uphold the cold and selfish policy of the distant\\nmonarchs of Europe.\\n\\nPerhaps no district throughout the wide extent of the intermediate\\nfrontiers can furnish a livelier picture of the cruelty and fierceness\\nof the savage warfare of those periods than the country which lies\\nbetween the head waters of the Hudson and the adjacent lakes.\\n\\nThe facilities which nature had there offered to the march of the\\ncombatants were too obvious to be neglected. The lengthened sheet of the\\nChamplain stretched from the frontiers of Canada, deep within the\\nborders of the neighboring province of New York, forming a natural\\npassage across half the distance that the French were compelled to\\nmaster in order to strike their enemies. Near its southern termination,\\nit received the contributions of another lake, whose waters were so\\nlimpid as to have been exclusively selected by the Jesuit missionaries\\nto perform the typical purification of baptism, and to obtain for it the\\ntitle of lake \"du Saint Sacrement.\" The less zealous English thought\\nthey conferred a sufficient honor on its unsullied fountains, when they\\nbestowed the name of their reigning prince, the second of the house of\\nHanover. The two united to rob the untutored possessors of its wooded\\nscenery of their native right to perpetuate its original appellation of\\n\"Horican.\"[1]\\n\\nWinding its way among countless islands, and imbedded in mountains, the\\n\"holy lake\" extended a dozen leagues still farther to the south. With\\nthe high plain that there interposed itself to the further passage of\\nthe water, commenced a portage of as many miles, which conducted the\\nadventurer to the banks of the Hudson, at a point where, with the usual\\nobstructions of the rapids, or rifts, as they were then termed in the\\nlanguage of the country, the river became navigable to the tide.\\n\\nWhile, in the pursuit of their daring plans of annoyance, the restless\\nenterprise of the French even attempted the distant and difficult gorges\\nof the Alleghany, it may easily be imagined that their proverbial\\nacuteness would not overlook the natural advantages of the district we\\nhave just described. It became, emphatically, the bloody arena, in which\\nmost of the battles for the mastery of the colonies were contested.\\nForts were erected at the different points that commanded the facilities\\nof the route, and were taken and retaken, razed and rebuilt, as victory\\nalighted on the hostile banners. While the husbandman shrank back from\\nthe dangerous passes, within the safer boundaries of the more ancient\\nsettlements, armies larger than those that had often disposed of the\\nsceptres of the mother countries, were seen to bury themselves in these\\nforests, whence they rarely returned but in skeleton bands, that were\\nhaggard with care, or dejected by defeat. Though the arts of peace were\\nunknown to this fatal region, its forests were alive with men; its\\nshades and glens rang with the sounds of martial music, and the echoes\\nof its mountains threw back the laugh, or repeated the wanton cry, of\\nmany a gallant and reckless youth, as he hurried by them, in the\\nnoontide of his spirits, to slumber in a long night of forgetfulness.\\n\\nIt was in this scene of strife and bloodshed that the incidents we shall\\nattempt to relate occurred, during the third year of the war which\\nEngland and France last waged for the possession of a country that\\nneither was destined to retain.\\n\\nThe imbecility of her military leaders abroad, and the fatal want of\\nenergy in her councils at home, had lowered the character of Great\\nBritain from the proud elevation on which it had been placed, by the\\ntalents and enterprise of her former warriors and statesmen. No longer\\ndreaded by her enemies, her servants were fast losing the confidence of\\nself-respect. In this mortifying abasement, the colonists, though\\ninnocent of her imbecility, and too humble to be the agents of her\\nblunders, were but the natural participators.\\n\\nThey had recently seen a chosen army from that country, which,\\nreverencing as a mother, they had blindly believed invincible--an army\\nled by a chief who had been selected from a crowd of trained warriors,\\nfor his rare military endowments, disgracefully routed by a handful of\\nFrench and Indians, and only saved from annihilation by the coolness and\\nspirit of a Virginian boy, whose riper fame has since diffused itself,\\nwith the steady influence of moral truth, to the uttermost confines of\\nChristendom.[2] A wide frontier had been laid naked by this unexpected\\ndisaster, and more substantial evils were preceded by a thousand\\nfanciful and imaginary dangers. The alarmed colonists believed that the\\nyells of the savages mingled with every fitful gust of wind that issued\\nfrom the interminable forests of the west. The terrific character of\\ntheir merciless enemies increased immeasurably the natural horrors of\\nwarfare. Numberless recent massacres were still vivid in their\\nrecollections; nor was there any ear in the provinces so deaf as not to\\nhave drunk in with avidity the narrative of some fearful tale of\\nmidnight murder, in which the natives of the forests were the principal\\nand barbarous actors. As the credulous and excited traveller related the\\nhazardous chances of the wilderness, the blood of the timid curdled\\nwith terror, and mothers cast anxious glances even at those children\\nwhich slumbered within the security of the largest towns. In short, the\\nmagnifying influence of fear began to set at naught the calculations of\\nreason, and to render those who should have remembered their manhood,\\nthe slaves of the basest of passions. Even the most confident and the\\nstoutest hearts began to think the issue of the contest was becoming\\ndoubtful; and that abject class was hourly increasing in numbers, who\\nthought they foresaw all the possessions of the English crown in America\\nsubdued by their Christian foes, or laid waste by the inroads of their\\nrelentless allies.\\n\\nWhen, therefore, intelligence was received at the fort, which covered\\nthe southern termination of the portage between the Hudson and the\\nlakes, that Montcalm had been seen moving up the Champlain, with an army\\n\"numerous as the leaves on the trees,\" its truth was admitted with more\\nof the craven reluctance of fear than with the stern joy that a warrior\\nshould feel, in finding an enemy within reach of his blow. The news had\\nbeen brought, towards the decline of a day in midsummer, by an Indian\\nrunner, who also bore an urgent request from Munro, the commander of a\\nwork on the shore of the \"holy lake,\" for a speedy and powerful\\nreinforcement. It has already been mentioned that the distance between\\nthese two posts was less than five leagues. The rude path, which\\noriginally formed their line of communication, had been widened for the\\npassage of wagons; so that the distance which had been travelled by the\\nson of the forest in two hours, might easily be effected by a detachment\\nof troops, with their necessary baggage, between the rising and setting\\nof a summer sun. The loyal servants of the British crown had given to\\none of these forest fastnesses the name of William Henry, and to the\\nother that of Fort Edward; calling each after a favorite prince of the\\nreigning family. The veteran Scotchman just named held the first, with a\\nregiment of regulars and a few provincials; a force really by far too\\nsmall to make head against the formidable power that Montcalm was\\nleading to the foot of his earthen mounds. At the latter, however, lay\\nGeneral Webb, who commanded the armies of the king in the northern\\nprovinces, with a body of more than five thousand men. By uniting the\\nseveral detachments of his command, this officer might have arrayed\\nnearly double that number of combatants against the enterprising\\nFrenchman, who had ventured so far from his reinforcements, with an army\\nbut little superior in numbers.\\n\\nBut under the influence of their degraded fortunes, both officers and\\nmen appeared better disposed to await the approach of their formidable\\nantagonists, within their works, than to resist the progress of their\\nmarch, by emulating the successful example of the French at Fort du\\nQuesne, and striking a blow on their advance.\\n\\nAfter the first surprise of the intelligence had a little abated, a\\nrumor was spread through the entrenched camp, which stretched along the\\nmargin of the Hudson, forming a chain of outworks to the body of the\\nfort itself, that a chosen detachment of fifteen hundred men was to\\ndepart, with the dawn, for William Henry, the post at the northern\\nextremity of the portage. That which at first was only rumor, soon\\nbecame certainty, as orders passed from the quarters of the\\ncommander-in-chief to the several corps he had selected for this\\nservice, to prepare for their speedy departure. All doubt as to the\\nintention of Webb now vanished, and an hour or two of hurried footsteps\\nand anxious faces succeeded. The novice in the military art flew from\\npoint to point, retarding his own preparations by the excess of his\\nviolent and somewhat distempered zeal; while the more practised veteran\\nmade his arrangements with a deliberation that scorned every appearance\\nof haste; though his sober lineaments and anxious eye sufficiently\\nbetrayed that he had no very strong professional relish for the as yet\\nuntried and dreaded warfare of the wilderness. At length the sun set in\\na flood of glory, behind the distant western hills, and as darkness drew\\nits veil around the secluded spot the sounds of preparation diminished;\\nthe last light finally disappeared from the log cabin of some officer;\\nthe trees cast their deeper shadows over the mounds and the rippling\\nstream, and a silence soon pervaded the camp, as deep as that which\\nreigned in the vast forest by which it was environed.\\n\\nAccording to the orders of the preceding night, the heavy sleep of the\\narmy was broken by the rolling of the warning drums, whose rattling\\nechoes were heard issuing, on the damp morning air, out of every vista\\nof the woods, just as day began to draw the shaggy outlines of some tall\\npines of the vicinity, on the opening brightness of a soft and cloudless\\neastern sky. In an instant the whole camp was in motion; the meanest\\nsoldier arousing from his lair to witness the departure of his\\ncomrades, and to share in the excitement and incidents of the hour. The\\nsimple array of the chosen band was soon completed. While the regular\\nand trained hirelings of the king marched with haughtiness to the right\\nof the line, the less pretending colonists took their humbler position\\non its left, with a docility that long practice had rendered easy. The\\nscouts departed; strong guards preceded and followed the lumbering\\nvehicles that bore the baggage; and before the gray light of the morning\\nwas mellowed by the rays of the sun, the main body of the combatants\\nwheeled into column, and left the encampment with a show of high\\nmilitary bearing, that served to drown the slumbering apprehensions of\\nmany a novice, who was now about to make his first essay in arms. While\\nin view of their admiring comrades, the same proud front and ordered\\narray was observed, until the notes of their fifes growing fainter in\\ndistance, the forest at length appeared to swallow up the living mass\\nwhich had slowly entered its bosom.\\n\\nThe deepest sounds of the retiring and invisible column had ceased to be\\nborne on the breeze to the listeners, and the latest straggler had\\nalready disappeared in pursuit; but there still remained the signs of\\nanother departure, before a log cabin of unusual size and\\naccommodations, in front of which those sentinels paced their rounds,\\nwho were known to guard the person of the English general. At this spot\\nwere gathered some half dozen horses, caparisoned in a manner which\\nshowed that two, at least, were destined to bear the persons of females,\\nof a rank that it was not usual to meet so far in the wilds of the\\ncountry. A third wore the trappings and arms of an officer of the staff;\\nwhile the rest, from the plainness of the housings, and the travelling\\nmails with which they were encumbered, were evidently fitted for the\\nreception of as many menials, who were, seemingly, already awaiting the\\npleasure of those they served. At a respectful distance from this\\nunusual show were gathered divers groups of curious idlers; some\\nadmiring the blood and bone of the high-mettled military charger, and\\nothers gazing at the preparations, with dull wonder of vulgar curiosity.\\nThere was one man, however, who, by his countenance and actions, formed\\na marked exception to those who composed the latter class of spectators,\\nbeing neither idle, nor seemingly very ignorant.\\n\\nThe person of this individual was to the last degree ungainly, without\\nbeing in any particular manner deformed. He had all the bones and joints\\nof other men, without any of their proportions. Erect, his stature\\nsurpassed that of his fellows; seated, he appeared reduced within the\\nordinary limits of the race. The same contrariety in his members seemed\\nto exist throughout the whole man. His head was large; his shoulders\\nnarrow; his arms long and dangling; while his hands were small, if not\\ndelicate. His legs and thighs were thin, nearly to emaciation, but of\\nextraordinary length; and his knees would have been considered\\ntremendous, had they not been outdone by the broader foundations on\\nwhich this false superstructure of the blended human orders was so\\nprofanely reared. The ill-assorted and injudicious attire of the\\nindividual only served to render his awkwardness more conspicuous. A\\nsky-blue coat, with short and broad skirts and low cape, exposed a long\\nthin neck, and longer and thinner legs, to the worst animadversions of\\nthe evil disposed. His nether garment was of yellow nankeen, closely\\nfitted to the shape, and tied at his bunches of knees by large knots of\\nwhite ribbon, a good deal sullied by use. Clouded cotton stockings, and\\nshoes, on one of the latter of which was a plated spur, completed the\\ncostume of the lower extremity of this figure, no curve or angle of\\nwhich was concealed, but, on the other hand, studiously exhibited,\\nthrough the vanity or simplicity of its owner. From beneath the flap of\\nan enormous pocket of a soiled vest of embossed silk, heavily ornamented\\nwith tarnished silver lace, projected an instrument, which, from being\\nseen in such martial company, might have been easily mistaken for some\\nmischievous and unknown implement of war. Small as it was, this uncommon\\nengine had excited the curiosity of most of the Europeans in the camp,\\nthough several of the provincials were seen to handle it, not only\\nwithout fear, but with the utmost familiarity. A large, civil cocked\\nhat, like those worn by clergymen within the last thirty years,\\nsurmounted the whole, furnishing dignity to a good-natured and somewhat\\nvacant countenance, that apparently needed such artificial aid, to\\nsupport the gravity of some high and extraordinary trust.\\n\\nWhile the common herd stood aloof, in deference to the quarters of Webb,\\nthe figure we have described stalked in the centre of the domestics,\\nfreely expressing his censures or commendations on the merits of the\\nhorses, as by chance they displeased or satisfied his judgment.\\n\\n\"This beast, I rather conclude, friend, is not of home raising, but is\\nfrom foreign lands, or perhaps from the little island itself over the\\nblue water?\" he said, in a voice as remarkable for the softness and\\nsweetness of its tones, as was his person for its rare proportions: \"I\\nmay speak of these things, and be no braggart; for I have been down at\\nboth havens; that which is situate at the mouth of Thames, and is named\\nafter the capital of Old England, and that which is called \\'Haven,\\' with\\nthe addition of the word \\'New\\'; and have seen the snows and brigantines\\ncollecting their droves, like the gathering to the ark, being outward\\nbound to the Island of Jamaica, for the purpose of barter and traffic in\\nfour-footed animals; but never before have I beheld a beast which\\nverified the true Scripture war-horse like this: \\'He paweth in the\\nvalley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth on to meet the armed\\nmen. He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle\\nafar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.\\' It would seem\\nthat the stock of the horse of Israel has descended to our own time;\\nwould it not, friend?\"\\n\\nReceiving no reply to this extraordinary appeal, which in truth, as it\\nwas delivered with the vigor of full and sonorous tones, merited some\\nsort of notice, he who had thus sung forth the language of the Holy Book\\nturned to the silent figure to whom he had unwittingly addressed\\nhimself, and found a new and more powerful subject of admiration in the\\nobject that encountered his gaze. His eyes fell on the still, upright,\\nand rigid form of the \"Indian runner,\" who had borne to the camp the\\nunwelcome tidings of the preceding evening. Although in a state of\\nperfect repose, and apparently disregarding, with characteristic\\nstoicism, the excitement and bustle around him, there was a sullen\\nfierceness mingled with the quiet of the savage, that was likely to\\narrest the attention of much more experienced eyes than those which now\\nscanned him, in unconcealed amazement. The native bore both the tomahawk\\nand knife of his tribe; and yet his appearance was not altogether that\\nof a warrior. On the contrary, there was an air of neglect about his\\nperson, like that which might have proceeded from great and recent\\nexertion, which he had not yet found leisure to repair. The colors of\\nthe war-paint had blended in dark confusion about his fierce\\ncountenance, and rendered his swarthy lineaments still more savage and\\nrepulsive than if art had attempted an effect which had been thus\\nproduced by chance. His eye, alone, which glistened like a fiery star\\namid lowering clouds, was to be seen in its state of native wildness.\\nFor a single instant, his searching and yet wary glance met the\\nwondering look of the other, and then changing its direction, partly in\\ncunning, and partly in disdain, it remained fixed, as if penetrating the\\ndistant air.\\n\\nIt is impossible to say what unlooked-for remark this short and silent\\ncommunication, between two such singular men, might have elicited from\\nthe white man, had not his active curiosity been again drawn to other\\nobjects. A general movement among the domestics, and a low sound of\\ngentle voices, announced the approach of those whose presence alone was\\nwanted to enable the cavalcade to move. The simple admirer of the\\nwar-horse instantly fell back to a low, gaunt, switch-tailed mare, that\\nwas unconsciously gleaning the faded herbage of the camp nigh by; where,\\nleaning with one elbow on the blanket that concealed an apology for a\\nsaddle, he became a spectator of the departure, while a foal was quietly\\nmaking its morning repast, on the opposite side of the same animal.\\n\\nA young man, in the dress of an officer, conducted to their steeds two\\nfemales, who, as it was apparent by their dresses, were prepared to\\nencounter the fatigues of a journey in the woods. One, and she was the\\nmost juvenile in her appearance, though both were young, permitted\\nglimpses of her dazzling complexion, fair golden hair, and bright blue\\neyes, to be caught, as she artlessly suffered the morning air to blow\\naside the green veil which descended low from her beaver. The flush\\nwhich still lingered above the pines in the western sky was not more\\nbright nor delicate than the bloom on her cheek; nor was the opening day\\nmore cheering than the animated smile which she bestowed on the youth,\\nas he assisted her into the saddle. The other, who appeared to share\\nequally in the attentions of the young officer, concealed her charms\\nfrom the gaze of the soldiery, with a care that seemed better fitted to\\nthe experience of four or five additional years. It could be seen,\\nhowever, that her person, though moulded with the same exquisite\\nproportions, of which none of the graces were lost by the travelling\\ndress she wore, was rather fuller and more mature than that of her\\ncompanion.\\n\\nNo sooner were these females seated, than their attendant sprang lightly\\ninto the saddle of the war-horse, when the whole three bowed to Webb,\\nwho, in courtesy, awaited their parting on the threshold of his cabin,\\nand turning their horses\\' heads, they proceeded at a slow amble,\\nfollowed by their train, towards the northern entrance of the\\nencampment. As they traversed that short distance, not a voice was\\nheard amongst them; but a slight exclamation proceeded from the younger\\nof the females, as the Indian runner glided by her, unexpectedly, and\\nled the way along the military road in her front. Though this sudden and\\nstartling movement of the Indian produced no sound from the other, in\\nthe surprise her veil also was allowed to open its folds, and betrayed\\nan indescribable look of pity, admiration, and horror, as her dark eye\\nfollowed the easy motions of the savage. The tresses of this lady were\\nshining and black, like the plumage of the raven. Her complexion was not\\nbrown, but it rather appeared charged with the color of the rich blood,\\nthat seemed ready to burst its bounds. And yet there was neither\\ncoarseness nor want of shadowing in a countenance that was exquisitely\\nregular and dignified, and surpassingly beautiful. She smiled, as if in\\npity at her own momentary forgetfulness, discovering by the act a row of\\nteeth that would have shamed the purest ivory; when, replacing the veil,\\nshe bowed her face, and rode in silence, like one whose thoughts were\\nabstracted from the scene around her.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \"Sola, sola, wo, ha, ho, sola!\"\\n\\n  SHAKESPEARE.\\n\\n\\nWhile one of the lovely beings we have so cursorily presented to the\\nreader was thus lost in thought, the other quickly recovered from the\\nalarm which induced the exclamation, and, laughing at her own weakness,\\nshe inquired of the youth who rode by her side,--\\n\\n\"Are such spectres frequent in the woods, Heyward; or is this sight an\\nespecial entertainment on our behalf? If the latter, gratitude must\\nclose our mouths; but if the former, both Cora and I shall have need to\\ndraw largely on that stock of hereditary courage which we boast, even\\nbefore we are made to encounter the redoubtable Montcalm.\"\\n\\n\"Yon Indian is a \\'runner\\' of the army; and, after the fashion of his\\npeople, he may be accounted a hero,\" returned the officer. \"He has\\nvolunteered to guide us to the lake, by a path but little known, sooner\\nthan if we followed the tardy movements of the column: and, by\\nconsequence, more agreeably.\"\\n\\n\"I like him not,\" said the lady, shuddering, partly in assumed, yet more\\nin real terror. \"You know him, Duncan, or you would not trust yourself\\nso freely to his keeping?\"\\n\\n\"Say, rather, Alice, that I would not trust you. I do know him, or he\\nwould not have my confidence, and least of all at this moment. He is\\nsaid to be a Canadian, too; and yet he served with our friends the\\nMohawks, who, as you know, are one of the six allied nations.[3] He was\\nbrought among us, as I have heard, by some strange accident in which\\nyour father was interested, and in which the savage was rigidly dealt\\nby--but I forget the idle tale; it is enough, that he is now our\\nfriend.\"\\n\\n\"If he has been my father\\'s enemy, I like him still less!\" exclaimed the\\nnow really anxious girl. \"Will you not speak to him, Major Heyward, that\\nI may hear his tones? Foolish though it may be, you have often heard me\\navow my faith in the tones of the human voice!\"\\n\\n\"It would be in vain; and answered, most probably, by an ejaculation.\\nThough he may understand it, he affects, like most of his people, to be\\nignorant of the English; and least of all will he condescend to speak\\nit, now that war demands the utmost exercise of his dignity. But he\\nstops; the private path by which we are to journey is, doubtless, at\\nhand.\"\\n\\nThe conjecture of Major Heyward was true. When they reached the spot\\nwhere the Indian stood, pointing into the thicket that fringed the\\nmilitary road, a narrow and blind path, which might, with some little\\ninconvenience, receive one person at a time, became visible.\\n\\n\"Here, then, lies our way,\" said the young man, in a low voice.\\n\"Manifest no distrust, or you may invite the danger you appear to\\napprehend.\"\\n\\n\"Cora, what think you?\" asked the reluctant fair one. \"If we journey\\nwith the troops, though we may find their presence irksome, shall we not\\nfeel better assurance of our safety?\"\\n\\n\"Being little accustomed to the practices of the savages, Alice, you\\nmistake the place of real danger,\" said Heyward. \"If enemies have\\nreached the portage at all, a thing by no means probable, as our scouts\\nare abroad, they will surely be found skirting the column where scalps\\nabound the most. The route of the detachment is known, while ours,\\nhaving been determined within the hour, must still be secret.\"\\n\\n\"Should we distrust the man because his manners are not our manners, and\\nthat his skin is dark?\" coldly asked Cora.\\n\\nAlice hesitated no longer; but giving her Narragansett[4] a smart cut\\nof the whip, she was the first to dash aside the slight branches of the\\nbushes, and to follow the runner along the dark and tangled pathway. The\\nyoung man regarded the last speaker in open admiration, and even\\npermitted her fairer though certainly not more beautiful companion to\\nproceed unattended, while he sedulously opened the way himself for the\\npassage of her who has been called Cora. It would seem that the\\ndomestics had been previously instructed; for, instead of penetrating\\nthe thicket, they followed the route of the column; a measure which\\nHeyward stated had been dictated by the sagacity of their guide, in\\norder to diminish the marks of their trail, if, haply, the Canadian\\nsavages should be lurking so far in advance of their army. For many\\nminutes the intricacy of the route admitted of no further dialogue;\\nafter which they emerged from the broad border of underbrush which grew\\nalong the line of the highway, and entered under the high but dark\\narches of the forest. Here their progress was less interrupted, and the\\ninstant the guide perceived that the females could command their steeds,\\nhe moved on, at a pace between a trot and a walk, and at a rate which\\nkept the sure-footed and peculiar animals they rode, at a fast yet easy\\namble. The youth had turned to speak to the dark-eyed Cora, when the\\ndistant sound of horses\\' hoofs, clattering over the roots of the broken\\nway in his rear, caused him to check his charger; and, as his companions\\ndrew their reins at the same instant, the whole party came to a halt, in\\norder to obtain an explanation of the unlooked-for interruption.\\n\\nIn a few moments a colt was seen gliding, like a fallow-deer, among the\\nstraight trunks of the pines; and, in another instant, the person of the\\nungainly man described in the preceding chapter, came into view, with as\\nmuch rapidity as he could excite his meagre beast to endure without\\ncoming to an open rupture. Until now this personage had escaped the\\nobservation of the travellers. If he possessed the power to arrest any\\nwandering eye when exhibiting the glories of his altitude on foot, his\\nequestrian graces were still more likely to attract attention.\\nNotwithstanding a constant application of his one armed heel to the\\nflanks of the mare, the most confirmed gait that he could establish was\\na Canterbury gallop with the hind legs, in which those more forward\\nassisted for doubtful moments, though generally content to maintain a\\nloping trot. Perhaps the rapidity of the changes from one of these paces\\nto the other created an optical illusion, which might thus magnify the\\npowers of the beast; for it is certain that Heyward, who possessed a\\ntrue eye for the merits of a horse, was unable, with his utmost\\ningenuity, to decide by what sort of movement his pursuer worked his\\nsinuous way on his footsteps with such persevering hardihood.\\n\\nThe industry and movements of the rider were not less remarkable than\\nthose of the ridden. At each change in the evolutions of the latter, the\\nformer raised his tall person in the stirrups; producing, in this\\nmanner, by the undue elongation of his legs, such sudden growths and\\ndiminishings of the stature, as baffled every conjecture that might be\\nmade as to his dimensions. If to this be added the fact that, in\\nconsequence of the ex parte application of the spur, one side of the\\nmare appeared to journey faster than the other; and that the aggrieved\\nflank was resolutely indicated by unremitted flourishes of a bushy tail,\\nwe finish the picture of both horse and man.\\n\\nThe frown which had gathered around the handsome, open, and manly brow\\nof Heyward, gradually relaxed, and his lips curled into a slight smile,\\nas he regarded the stranger. Alice made no very powerful effort to\\ncontrol her merriment; and even the dark, thoughtful eye of Cora lighted\\nwith a humor that, it would seem, the habit, rather than the nature of\\nits mistress repressed.\\n\\n\"Seek you any here?\" demanded Heyward, when the other had arrived\\nsufficiently nigh to abate his speed; \"I trust you are no messenger of\\nevil tidings?\"\\n\\n\"Even so,\" replied the stranger, making diligent use of his triangular\\ncastor, to produce a circulation in the close air of the woods, and\\nleaving his hearers in doubt to which of the young man\\'s questions he\\nresponded; when, however, he had cooled his face, and recovered his\\nbreath, he continued, \"I hear you are riding to William Henry; as I am\\njourneying thitherward myself, I concluded good company would seem\\nconsistent to the wishes of both parties.\"\\n\\n\"You appear to possess the privilege of a casting vote,\" returned\\nHeyward; \"we are three, whilst you have consulted no one but yourself.\"\\n\\n\"Even so. The first point to be obtained is to know one\\'s own mind. Once\\nsure of that, and where women are concerned, it is not easy, the next\\nis, to act up to the decision. I have endeavored to do both, and here I\\nam.\"\\n\\n\"If you journey to the lake, you have mistaken your route,\" said\\nHeyward, haughtily; \"the highway thither is at least half a mile behind\\nyou.\"\\n\\n\"Even so,\" returned the stranger, nothing daunted by this cold\\nreception; \"I have tarried at \\'Edward\\' a week, and I should be dumb not\\nto have inquired the road I was to journey; and if dumb there would be\\nan end to my calling.\" After simpering in a small way, like one whose\\nmodesty prohibited a more open expression of his admiration of a\\nwitticism that was perfectly unintelligible to his hearers, he\\ncontinued: \"It is not prudent for any one of my profession to be too\\nfamiliar with those he is to instruct; for which reason I follow not the\\nline of the army; besides which, I conclude that a gentleman of your\\ncharacter has the best judgment in matters of wayfaring; I have\\ntherefore decided to join company, in order that the ride may be made\\nagreeable, and partake of social communion.\"\\n\\n\"A most arbitrary, if not a hasty decision!\" exclaimed Heyward,\\nundecided whether to give vent to his growing anger, or to laugh in the\\nother\\'s face. \"But you speak of instruction, and of a profession; are\\nyou an adjunct to the provincial corps, as a master of the noble science\\nof defence and offence; or, perhaps, you are one who draws lines and\\nangles, under the pretence of expounding the mathematics?\"\\n\\nThe stranger regarded his interrogator a moment, in wonder; and then,\\nlosing every mark of self-satisfaction in an expression of solemn\\nhumility, he answered:--\\n\\n\"Of offence, I hope there is none, to either party: of defence, I make\\nnone--by God\\'s good mercy, having committed no palpable sin since last\\nentreating his pardoning grace. I understand not your allusions about\\nlines and angles; and I leave expounding to those who have been called\\nand set apart for that holy office. I lay claim to no higher gift than a\\nsmall insight into the glorious art of petitioning and thanksgiving, as\\npractised in psalmody.\"\\n\\n\"The man is, most manifestly, a disciple of Apollo,\" cried the amused\\nAlice, \"and I take him under my own especial protection. Nay, throw\\naside that frown, Heyward, and in pity to my longing ears, suffer him to\\njourney in our train. Besides,\" she added, in a low and hurried voice,\\ncasting a glance at the distant Cora, who slowly followed the footsteps\\nof their silent but sullen guide, \"it may be a friend added to our\\nstrength, in time of need.\"\\n\\n\"Think you, Alice, that I would trust those I love by this secret path,\\ndid I imagine such need could happen?\"\\n\\n\"Nay, nay, I think not of it now; but this strange man amuses me; and if\\nhe \\'hath music in his soul,\\' let us not churlishly reject his company.\"\\nShe pointed persuasively along the path with her riding-whip, while\\ntheir eyes met in a look which the young man lingered a moment to\\nprolong; then yielding to her gentle influence, he clapped his spurs\\ninto his charger, and in a few bounds was again at the side of Cora.\\n\\n\"I am glad to encounter thee, friend,\" continued the maiden, waving her\\nhand to the stranger to proceed, as she urged her Narragansett to renew\\nits amble. \"Partial relatives have almost persuaded me that I am not\\nentirely worthless in a duet myself; and we may enliven our wayfaring by\\nindulging in our favorite pursuit. It might be of signal advantage to\\none, ignorant as I, to hear the opinions and experience of a master in\\nthe art.\"\\n\\n\"It is refreshing both to the spirits and to the body to indulge in\\npsalmody, in befitting seasons,\" returned the master of song,\\nunhesitatingly complying with her intimation to follow; \"and nothing\\nwould relieve the mind more than such a consoling communion. But four\\nparts are altogether necessary to the perfection of melody. You have all\\nthe manifestations of a soft and rich treble; I can, by especial aid,\\ncarry a full tenor to the highest letter; but we lack counter and bass!\\nYon officer of the king, who hesitated to admit me to his company, might\\nfill the latter, if one may judge from the intonations of his voice in\\ncommon dialogue.\"\\n\\n\"Judge not too rashly from hasty and deceptive appearances,\" said the\\nlady, smiling; \"though Major Heyward can assume such deep notes on\\noccasion, believe me, his natural tones are better fitted for a mellow\\ntenor than the bass you heard.\"\\n\\n\"Is he, then, much practised in the art of psalmody?\" demanded her\\nsimple companion.\\n\\nAlice felt disposed to laugh, though she succeeded in suppressing her\\nmerriment, ere she answered,--\\n\\n\"I apprehend that he is rather addicted to profane song. The chances of\\na soldier\\'s life are but little fitted for the encouragement of more\\nsober inclinations.\"\\n\\n\"Man\\'s voice is given to him, like his other talents, to be used, and\\nnot to be abused. None can say they have ever known me neglect my gifts!\\nI am thankful that, though my boyhood may be said to have been set\\napart, like the youth of the royal David, for the purposes of music, no\\nsyllable of rude verse has ever profaned my lips.\"\\n\\n\"You have, then, limited your efforts to sacred song?\"\\n\\n\"Even so. As the psalms of David exceed all other language, so does the\\npsalmody that has been fitted to them by the divines and sages of the\\nland, surpass all vain poetry. Happily, I may say that I utter nothing\\nbut the thoughts and the wishes of the King of Israel himself; for\\nthough the times may call for some slight changes, yet does this version\\nwhich we use in the colonies of New England, so much exceed all other\\nversions, that, by its richness, its exactness, and its spiritual\\nsimplicity, it approacheth, as near as may be, to the great work of the\\ninspired writer. I never abide in any place, sleeping or waking, without\\nan example of this gifted work. \\'Tis the six-and-twentieth edition,\\npromulgated at Boston, Anno Domini 1744; and is entitled, _The Psalms,\\nHymns, and Spiritual Songs of the Old and New Testaments; faithfully\\ntranslated into English Metre, for the Use, Edification, and Comfort of\\nthe Saints, in Public and Private, especially in New England_.\"\\n\\nDuring this eulogium on the rare production of his native poets, the\\nstranger had drawn the book from his pocket, and, fitting a pair of\\niron-rimmed spectacles to his nose, opened the volume with a care and\\nveneration suited to its sacred purposes. Then, without circumlocution\\nor apology, first pronouncing the word \"Standish,\" and placing the\\nunknown engine, already described, to his mouth, from which he drew a\\nhigh, shrill sound, that was followed by an octave below, from his own\\nvoice, he commenced singing the following words, in full, sweet, and\\nmelodious tones, that set the music, the poetry, and even the uneasy\\nmotion of his ill-trained beast at defiance:--\\n\\n  \"How good it is, O see,\\n    And how it pleaseth well,\\n  Together, e\\'en in unity,\\n    For brethren so to dwell.\\n  It\\'s like the choice ointment,\\n    From the head to the beard did go:\\n  Down Aaron\\'s beard, that downward went,\\n    His garment\\'s skirts unto.\"\\n\\nThe delivery of these skilful rhymes was accompanied, on the part of the\\nstranger, by a regular rise and fall of his right hand, which\\nterminated at the descent, by suffering the fingers to dwell a moment on\\nthe leaves of the little volume; and on the ascent, by such a flourish\\nof the member as none but the initiated may ever hope to imitate. It\\nwould seem that long practice had rendered this manual accompaniment\\nnecessary; for it did not cease until the preposition which the poet had\\nselected for the close of his verse, had been duly delivered like a word\\nof two syllables.\\n\\nSuch an innovation on the silence and retirement of the forest could not\\nfail to enlist the ears of those who journeyed at so short a distance in\\nadvance. The Indian muttered a few words in broken English to Heyward,\\nwho, in his turn, spoke to the stranger; at once interrupting, and, for\\nthe time, closing his musical efforts.\\n\\n\"Though we are not in danger, common prudence would teach us to journey\\nthrough this wilderness in as quiet a manner as possible. You will,\\nthen, pardon me, Alice, should I diminish your enjoyments, by requesting\\nthis gentleman to postpone his chant until a safer opportunity.\"\\n\\n\"You will diminish them, indeed,\" returned the arch girl, \"for never did\\nI hear a more unworthy conjunction of execution and language, than that\\nto which I have been listening; and I was far gone in a learned inquiry\\ninto the causes of such an unfitness between sound and sense, when you\\nbroke the charm of my musings by that bass of yours, Duncan!\"\\n\\n\"I know not what you call my bass,\" said Heyward, piqued at her remark,\\n\"but I know that your safety, and that of Cora, is far dearer to me than\\ncould be any orchestra of Handel\\'s music.\" He paused and turned his head\\nquickly towards a thicket, and then bent his eyes suspiciously on their\\nguide, who continued his steady pace, in undisturbed gravity. The young\\nman smiled to himself, for he believed he had mistaken some shining\\nberry of the woods for the glistening eyeballs of a prowling savage, and\\nhe rode forward, continuing the conversation which had been interrupted\\nby the passing thought.\\n\\nMajor Heyward was mistaken only in suffering his youthful and generous\\npride to suppress his active watchfulness. The cavalcade had not long\\npassed, before the branches of the bushes that formed the thicket were\\ncautiously moved asunder, and a human visage, as fiercely wild as savage\\nart and unbridled passions could make it, peered out on the retiring\\nfootsteps of the travellers. A gleam of exultation shot across the\\ndarkly painted lineaments of the inhabitant of the forest, as he traced\\nthe route of his intended victims, who rode unconsciously onward; the\\nlight and graceful forms of the females waving among the trees, in the\\ncurvatures of their path, followed at each bend by the manly figure of\\nHeyward, until, finally, the shapeless person of the singing-master was\\nconcealed behind the numberless trunks of trees, that rose, in dark\\nlines, in the intermediate space.\\n\\n\\n\\n'"

       "'Before any characters appear, the time and geography are made clear. Though it is the last war that England and France waged for a country that neither would retain, the wilderness between the forces still has to be overcome first. Thus it is in 1757, in the New York area between the head waters of the Hudson River and Lake George to the north. Because only two years earlier General Braddock was disgracefully routed by a handful of French and Indians, the frontier is now exposed to real and imaginary savage disasters as well as to the horrors of warfare. Fear has replaced reason. Near dusk of a day in July, an Indian runner named Magua arrives at Fort Edward on the upper Hudson. He has come from Fort William Henry at the southern tip of Lake George with the news that the French General Montcalm is moving south with a very large army and that Munro, commander of Fort William Henry, is in urgent need of plentiful reinforcements from General Webb. Early the next morning, a limited detachment of fifteen hundred regulars and colonists departs as if swallowed by the forest. Shortly afterwards, Major Duncan Heyward and Alice and Cora Munro, guided by Magua on foot, take by horseback a secret route toward William Henry for the girls to join their father. Blonde Alice is doubtful about Magua, covered with war paint and showing a sullen fierceness; but dark-haired Cora is stoically common sense about him, even though Heyward mentions that their father had once had to deal rigidly with the Indian. As the small party pushes on, they are overtaken by David Gamut, a tall, ungainly psalmodist ridiculously dressed and carrying a pitch pipe while riding a mare followed by its young colt. He desires to join them, and after some banter between him and Alice, he pulls out the twenty-sixth edition of The Bay Psalm Book, sounds his pipe, and renders a song \"in full, sweet, and melodious tones.\" At a muttered comment from Magua, Heyward insists upon silence for safety. Then he glances about them and, satisfied that he has seen only shining berries, smiles to himself as they move on. But he is wrong. The branches move and a man peers exultingly after them as they disappear among the dark lines of trees.'"

The battle was fought between a British army under General Edward Braddock and a larger French and Indian force led by Pierre Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville. The French were attempting to establish a foothold in the Ohio Valley, while the British were defending Fort Duquesne (present-day Pittsburgh) against a larger French and Indian army. The battle was fouught over two days with significant losses on both sides, including the deaths of General Braddock and several other officers. However, the British emerged victorious, marking the beginning of the French and Indian War (1754-1763) and establishing British control over the Ohio Valley. The battle was fought in a dense fog that made it difficult for the British to see their enemies, and the French and Indian forces were led by Pierre Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville, who had previously participated in the Battle of Lake George (1755) against the British. The battle was notable for the use of cannon and musketry by both sides, with the British using their larger guns to bombard the French and Indian positions, while the French and Indians employed their smaller weapons such as arquebuses and muskets. Overall, the Battle of Fort Duquesne was a significant victory for the British, who emerged victorious in the war against France and established control over the Ohio Valley.']"

       "['Before any characters appear, the time and geography are made clear. Though it is the last war that England and France waged for a country that neither would retain, the wilderness between the forces still has to be overcome first. Thus it is in 1757, in the New York area between the head waters of the Hudson River and Lake George to the north. Because only two years earlier General Braddock was disgracefully routed by a handful of French and Indians, the frontier is now exposed to real and imaginary savage disasters as well as to the horrors of warfare. Fear has replaced reason. Near dusk of a day in July, an Indian runner named Magua arrives at Fort Edward on the upper Hudson. He has come from Fort William Henry at the southern tip of Lake George with the news that the French General Montcalm is moving south with a very large army and that Munro, commander of Fort William Henry, is in urgent need of plentiful reinforcements from General Webb. Early the next morning, a limited detachment of fifteen hundred regulars and colonists departs as if swallowed by the forest. Shortly afterwards, Major Duncan Heyward and Alice and Cora Munro, guided by Magua on foot, take by horseback a secret route toward William Henry for the girls to join their father. Blonde Alice is doubtful about Magua, covered with war paint and showing a sullen fierceness; but dark-haired Cora is stoically common sense about him, even though Heyward mentions that their father had once had to deal rigidly with the Indian. As the small party pushes on, they are overtaken by David Gamut, a tall, ungainly psalmodist ridiculously dressed and carrying a pitch pipe while riding a mare followed by its young colt. He desires to join them, and after some banter between him and Alice, he pulls out the twenty-sixth edition of The Bay Psalm Book, sounds his pipe, and renders a song \"in full, sweet, and melodious tones.\" At a muttered comment from Magua, Heyward insists upon silence for safety. Then he glances about them and, satisfied that he has seen only shining berries, smiles to himself as they move on. But he is wrong. The branches move and a man peers exultingly after them as they disappear among the dark lines of trees.',\n",
       " 'In another part of the forest by the river a few miles to the west, Hawkeye and Chingachgook appear to be waiting for someone as they talk with low voices. It is now afternoon. The Indian and the scout are attired according to their forest habits: Chingachgook with his semi-nude, war-painted body and scalping tuft of hair, his tomahawk, scalping knife, and short rifle; Hawkeye with his hunting shirt, skin cap, buckskin leggings, knife, pouch and horn, and long rifle. They discuss their respective forefathers, and Chingachgook relates the slow demise of his tribe of Mohicans so that only he and his son Uncas now remain. At the mention of his name, Uncas, a youthful warrior dressed much like Hawkeye, appears and says that he has been on the trail of the Maquas, another name for the Mengwe or Iroquois, their natural enemies. The antlers of a deer are seen in the distance, and Hawkeye is about to shoot the animal for food when the warrior warns him that a shot will warn the enemy. Just as Uncas kills it with an arrow, they hear the sounds of feet which Chingachgook recognizes as the horses of white men.',\n",
       " 'When the mounted party from Fort Howard approaches the three men of the woods, Hawkeye addresses first Gamut and then Heyward only to learn that they are lost because their Indian guide has taken them west instead of north toward Fort William Henry. Doubtful, especially when he learns that the guide is a Huron who has been adopted by the Mohawks, Hawkeye makes an a priori judgment of the still-unseen guide and uses the contemptuous term Mingo: \"he who is born a Mingo will die a Mingo.\" His two Indian companions concur with his thinking. Still doubting and cautious, be baits Heyward by bantering away about Indians until Heyward reveals that he is the major of the 60th regiment of the king at William Henry. Walking to the rear of the party for a look at Magua, Hawkeye returns and says that he could guide them back to Fort Edward, which is only an hour\\'s journey away, but that it would be impossible because of the ladies and the dangers of coming night, particularly with the Mohawk as a companion. He suggests his shooting and disabling Magua from where he stands, but the major will not hear of it. Consequently, as the sun goes down, he sends the two Mohicans through the thickets on opposite sides of the path and tells the major to engage Magua in talk while he himself converses with Gamut. Magua proudly refers to himself as Le Renard Subtil , the name his Canada fathers have given him. He is cautiously quiet but allows Heyward to convince him to sit and eat. As slight sounds in the thicket make Le Renard alert, Heyward dismounts, determined to seize the treacherous guide, but the latter strikes up the major\\'s arm, gives a piercing cry, and darts away into the thicket. Immediately Chingachgook and Uncas appear and give swift pursuit just as a flash comes from Hawkeye\\'s rifle.',\n",
       " 'The pursuit of Magua is unsuccessful, but Hawkeye feels that he has wounded him slightly and is certain of it when they find bloodstains on the sumach leaves. Heyward wants to continue the chase, but the scout fears an ambush, particularly since he has fired his rifle, an action for which he upbraids himself. With night almost upon them, the three woodsmen confer and, at the urging of Uncas, decide to take the group to their \"harboring place\" after Heyward promises to keep the place a secret. The horses are a problem, but rather than give them their bridles, the men agree to mislead the foe into thinking that the group is on horseback. When the colt makes a noise in the bush, the scout determines that of necessity it must die so that it cannot betray them. Uncas shoots it with an arrow and Chingachgook quickly and mercifully slits its throat and dashes it into the river to float away. While the Indians lead the horses into the river, Hawkeye and Heyward place the females in a bark canoe and, trailed by the dejected Gamut, wade in to bear it upstream toward the waterfall, passing the dark overhang of the bank where the horses are now hidden. At the falls, the scout seats all the whites in the canoe and poles it into the center of the turbulent stream, where it is whirled about until he brings it to rest beside a flat rock. \"You are at the foot of Glenn\\'s,\" he says and takes the canoe to fetch the Mohicans and the venison. When they are all together, he worriedly tells that the horses had cowered as if they scented wolves that would hover near Indian kills. He is interrupted by a sad song from Gamut, whom he tries to console for the death of the colt. Then he and the two Mohicans disappear in succession, \"seeming to vanish against the dark face of a perpendicular rock.\"',\n",
       " 'Heyward and the girls are uneasy and Gamut is still struggling in spirit when a light flashes upon them and they see that the others have entered a cavern hidden by a blanket. Hawkeye is holding a blazing knot of pine which silhouettes Uncas, the first clear sight of whose carriage and almost Grecian features relieves the lingering doubts of those from Fort Edward. When the latter also enter the cavern, they learn that at the other entrance is a narrow, open chasm running at right angles and that just beyond it is another cave. They are essentially on an island of rock with the falls and turbulent water on both sides. As they take their meal of venison, Uncas makes an innovation on his Indian customs by attending the females, betraying a bit more interest in Cora than in Alice. In spite of his continuous vigilance, Hawkeye draws out a keg and invites Gamut to \"try a little spruce.\" After they discuss Gamut\\'s name and profession, the psalmodist and the girls render a sacred number that is safely muffled by the noise of the falls. The memory of his boyhood in the settlements brings tears to the scout\\'s eyes just as the song is interrupted by a sudden, unearthly cry. In the ensuing stillness, Uncas cautiously steps outside but can see nothing to identify the unknown sound. Heyward takes the girls into the inner cave for sleep and inspects the far entrance to find directly beneath his feet an impenetrable barrier of roiling water. Though yet stoical, Cora seems for the first time to feel it rash to be trying to visit their father during this crisis. Heyward is reassuring the girls about Munro\\'s feelings for them when the horrid cry fills the air again. Within a moment, the blanket-entrance is raised and the scout stands there, his face reflecting everyone\\'s fearful sense of mystery and his own growing dismay.',\n",
       " 'Feeling that the cry is some kind of warning, whether intended or not, Hawkeye leads the entire party from the caves. As Heyward remarks upon the loveliness of the scene, the horrifying sound comes again as if from the bed of the river, and Heyward now recognizes it as the shriek of a horse in terror. The scout\\'s reckoning that the horses are frightened by hovering wolves is immediately confirmed by a long howl that swiftly recedes into the depths of the forest, an abandonment that indicates enemy Indians are near. Once again secure in his knowledge of things, Hawkeye directs everyone to hide in moon shadows where they have a full view of both shores. Hours pass, and all fall asleep except the ever watchful scout and the Mohicans. The moon sets, and as pale dawn begins, the Iroquois attack with hellish yells and rifle reports. Gamut exposes himself, is wounded, and falls unconscious, while Hawkeye slips below and shoots one enemy, afterwards saying that their only hope is to hold the rock until Munro sends a party to help them. Heyward takes the girls into the outer cave where the reviving Gamut has been taken. As Cora reminds him how much his safety means to them, the major glances at Alice, reassures them, and rejoins the others outside. He and the scout deploy themselves in a little thicket of pines below the rock that splits the falls. Dawn comes. Then a long, anxious, and quiet watch succeeds until Hawkeye detects that four Indians have swum dangerously down to the rock above the defenders. As they wait, a fifth one, struggling to reach the rock, is thrown into the air and over the falls with a single, despairing shriek. After whistling Uncas to them, Hawkeye and the warrior shoot two Indians as the four charge them. When Heyward\\'s pistols misfire, he and the scout grapple hand-to-hand with the two remaining enemies until Hawkeye dispatches his foe with a knife. Heyward is about to be dragged over the precipice with the other when Uncas severs the tendons of the Iroquois\\' wrist and grabs Heyward as the wounded savage falls to his destruction. As the survivors take cover, the Indians on shore yell and fire, and a give-and-take battle begins. One Iroquois, who has climbed an oak tree near shore, fires down upon the protagonists and slightly wounds Heyward. Setting up a crossfire with Chingachgook, Hawkeye fires his rifle \"Killdeer\" and wounds the savage, who is left swinging in the wind with a desperate grasp on a branch. To save powder, the scout refuses to show mercy and finish the kill, but he weakens and discharges his last powder and bullet as the man falls toward the rocks and water. Uncas goes for munitions in the canoe only to find an Indian swimming away with it. Now essentially bereft of defensive means, the Mohicans scoff at their enemies and prepare for death. Hawkeye is quietly and stoically preparing himself also when Cora, who has been brave all along, entreats the men to escape downstream and effect a rescue. Convinced of her reason, Chingachgook slips under the water and away. After telling her to leave a marked trail if they are captured, Hawkeye carefully lays \"Killdeer\" aside and disappears into the water. Uncas remains until Cora, lowering her eyes, asks him to go to her father as her \"most confidential\" messenger; then he also drops into the water. When Heyward refuses to leave on the grounds that his presence may keep the girls from evils worse than death, Cora draws \"the nearly insensible Alice after her into the deepest recess of the inner cavern.\"',\n",
       " 'In the stillness that follows, Heyward finds it hard to believe what has happened, especially as nature seems to reassert itself with the song of birds. Nonetheless, they all hide in the cave, Gamut still addled and Alice trembling and weeping against Cora\\'s breast. The major closes the inner entrance with the blanket and a pile of sassafras, then seats himself with a pistol clenched convulsively in his hand. Gamut sings \"Isle of Wight,\" which is interrupted by savage yells from the center of the island as a rush of voices pours down the island. When a triumphant cry is followed by the shout, \"La Longue Carabine!\" Heyward for the first time realizes that his late companion was the celebrated hunter and scout of the English camp, and he feels certain that their friends have escaped. As the Indians enter the neighboring cavern, the major peers out of his sassafras entrance, sees the gigantic chief, and watches as exultant warriors bring blood-stained brush from the other cave and unwittingly pile it against his entrance. Though the Indians\\' shouts indicate anger in seeing their own dead and disappointment at finding no prisoners or dead enemies, Heyward feels that perhaps now they are safe. However, just as Alice begins to offer thanks, the features of Le Renard Subtil appear at the other entrance and the major fires his pistol without success. There is only a moment of surprise before a clamorous rush captures the four whites, who are dragged outside and surrounded by the triumphant Hurons.',\n",
       " 'Though at first menaced by the Hurons, Heyward is held for questioning, but he has to turn for interpretation to Magua, whom he sees Hawkeye had wounded on the shoulder. When he finally convinces them that the three woodsmen have escaped, they are furious, and one savage grabs Alice by the hair in a mock scalping. Before real violence can occur, the chief calls a brief council and the entire party crosses to the south bank of the river where the horses are. Mounted on Heyward\\'s charger, the chief leads most of his people away across river, leaving the prisoners in charge of six Indians headed by Magua. The major tries to secure Magua\\'s help by privately implying that he and the redskin have been in collusion to fool the Hurons all along and by offering rewards. Although Heyward adopts the sententious speech of the Indians, Magua is noncommittal as the group heads south, the sisters mounted and the others afoot. Flanked by the Indians, Cora finds it difficult to leave signs on the trail; once when she drops a glove, she is detected and severely warned by one of their conductors. Never speaking, Magua steadily leads the way through the forests and hills until they finally reach a steep, pyramidal hill with a level summit and few trees -- a perfect place for defense and for avoiding surprise. While the warriors eat the raw meat of a fawn, Heyward again engages Magua in talk. Heyward\\'s expression of Munro\\'s love for his daughters brings a gleam of malignant joy to the Indian\\'s face, and the latter insists upon a private talk with Cora. He proudly tells her that he was born a chief but that, after the Canadians taught him to drink firewater, he was driven from his tribe. Once when working for Munro, he came into Munro\\'s cabin drunk and the latter had him tied up and whipped like a dog before the soldiers. He demands, is it \"justice to make evil, and then punish for it?\" Wanting injury for injury, he says he will let Alice go if Cora will come with him as his wife: \"The body of the gray-head would sleep among his cannon, but his heart would lie within reach of the knife of Le Subtil.\" Cora is indignant and returns to her fellow captives. Magua goes to the lolling savages and begins a skillful harangue, building their emotions to the point of rage and vengeance. As they rush upon their prisoners with drawn knives and uplifted tomahawks, Magua villainously invites them to prolong the victims\\' misery. Heyward and Gamut struggle to no avail, and all four are tied to saplings while splinters and fire are prepared for the torture. Magua again makes his proposal, and Cora leaves the decision to Alice, who hesitates in her weakness but finally says no. Gnashing his teeth, the Huron hurls his tomahawk just above Alice\\'s head, cutting some of her ringlets. Maddened, Heyward snaps his bonds and rushes upon another Indian who is about to throw his weapon. In the struggle, Heyward goes down and the Indian raises his knife fatally. But the crack of a rifle is heard, and the Indian\\'s look changes to vacant wildness as he falls dead on the faded leaves beside Heyward.',\n",
       " 'Since the Indians\\' rifles have been placed to the side, Hawkeye has found his, loaded it, and fired it. He and the Mohicans advance to hand-to-hand combat, Uncas jumping protectively in front of Cora and saving her a moment later by killing an Indian whose tomahawk has cut her bonds. Soon all the Hurons are dead except Magua, who is fighting with Chingachgook. The villain feigns death and escapes before Hawkeye can brain him with the butt of his rifle. Chingachgook scalps the dead while Uncas and Heyward assist the females and Hawkeye releases Gamut. The scout advises the singing master to give up his \"little tooting instrument\" for a useful weapon, and Gamut counters by arguing the fatality of Calvinistic doctrine found in books. Completely the practical man, Hawkeye disdainfully says that the only book worth reading is nature. Gamut\\'s response is to sing a song, but Hawkeye common-sensically reloads his rifle and sees that everyone is armed. Then they start their journey with the girls riding the Narragansets. They very shortly stop and clear the leaves and clay from a hidden mineral spring, and Hawkeye tells how the three of them, sagaciously aided by Uncas, had tracked the Hurons for twenty miles. After a simple cooked meal, they proceed towards the north where Fort William Henry lies.',\n",
       " 'Now that the afternoon is shortening, Hawkeye leads the party many toilsome miles to an open space surrounding a low, green hillock crowned by a rude, decayed block-house, the scene of a victorious youthful battle for Chingachgook and the scout. Under the hillock are the long-dead Mohawks, the memory of whom makes Hawkeye once again refer to the two Mohicans as the last of their tribe. All except Chingachgook fall asleep and awaken at the rising of the moon to continue their journey. Before they can leave, they hear the steps of some twenty enemy Indians who have apparently lost their trail. While the protagonists wait in quiet suspense, two Hurons approach the mound but warily withdraw out of respect for the dead. As soon as the sounds of the hunters completely fade away, the seven fugitives silently head north again. After tactically walking barefoot in a stream for an hour, they turn again to the plain and reach the \"bloody pond,\" where in a previous battle Frenchmen had been surprised, slain, and tossed into the water. Being now near the French outposts, they encounter a French sentinel, whom Heyward fools by answering in French and whom Chingachgook slips upon, kills, and scalps. Since they must turn back for safety, Hawkeye leads them up a mountain from which, as morning comes, they can see to the east Fort William Henry on the southern tip of Lake George. Between them and the fort are General Montcalm\\'s ten thousand Frenchmen, while to the southeast is the camped detachment from Fort Edward. Firing has already started, but as a great fog descends, the party plans to push through it to the fort. They have strayed from their way when a cannon ball from the fort rolls to a stop near them and they decide to follow its furrow to safety. Again running into French forces, they have to flee and become lost until Uncas finds the furrow again. They are hotly pursued, but within minutes they are beneath the walls of the fort, where Munro recognizes the voice of Alice and orders his men out the sally-port. Led by Heyward, the English disperse the French as the gigantic, grey-haired Munro, large tears rolling down his cheeks, embraces his two daughters in his arms.']"

However, the British emerged victorious, marking the beginning of the French and Indian War (1754-1763) and establishing British control over the Ohio Valley. The battle was fought in a dense fog that made it difficult for the British to see their enemies, and the French and Indian forces were led by Pierre Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville, who had previously participated in the Battle of Lake George (1755) against the British. The battle was notable for the use of cannon and musketry by both sides, with the British using their larger guns to bombard the French and Indian positions, while the French and Indians employed their smaller weapons such as arquebuses and muskets. Overall, the Battle of Fort Duquesne was a significant victory for the British, who emerged victorious in the war against France and established control over the Ohio Valley.']"
